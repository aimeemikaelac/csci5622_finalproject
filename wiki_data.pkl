VIn mathematics, and more specifically in general topology, compactness is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed (that is, containing all its limit points) and bounded (that is, having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other). Examples include a closed interval, a rectangle, or a finite set of points. This notion is defined for more general topological spaces than Euclidean space in various ways.\u000aOne such generalization is that a space is sequentially compact if any infinite sequence of points sampled from the space must frequently (infinitely often) get arbitrarily close to some point of the space. An equivalent definition is that every sequence of points must have an infinite subsequence that converges to some point of the space. The Heine-Borel theorem states that a subset of Euclidean space is compact in this sequential sense if and only if it is closed and bounded. Thus, if one chooses an infinite number of points in the closed unit interval [0, 1] some of those points must get arbitrarily close to some real number in that space. For instance, some of the numbers 1/2, 4/5, 1/3, 5/6, 1/4, 6/7, \u2026 accumulate to 0 (others accumulate to 1). The same set of points would not accumulate to any point of the open unit interval (0, 1); so the open unit interval is not compact. Euclidean space itself is not compact since it is not bounded. In particular, the sequence of points 0,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u2009\u2026 has no subsequence that converges to any given real number.\u000aApart from closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space, typical examples of compact spaces include spaces consisting not of geometrical points but of functions. The term compact was introduced into mathematics by Maurice Fréchet in 1904 as a distillation of this concept. Compactness in this more general situation plays an extremely important role in mathematical analysis, because many classical and important theorems of 19th century analysis, such as the extreme value theorem, are easily generalized to this situation. A typical application is furnished by the Arzelà\u2013Ascoli theorem or the Peano existence theorem, in which one is able to conclude the existence of a function with some required properties as a limiting case of some more elementary construction.\u000aVarious equivalent notions of compactness, including sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces. In general topological spaces, however, different notions of compactness are not necessarily equivalent. The most useful notion, which is the standard definition of the unqualified term compactness, is phrased in terms of the existence of finite families of open sets that "cover" the space in the sense that each point of the space must lie in some set contained in the family. This more subtle notion, introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn in 1929, exhibits compact spaces as generalizations of finite sets. In spaces that are compact in this sense, it is often possible to patch together information that holds locally\u2014that is, in a neighborhood of each point\u2014into corresponding statements that hold throughout the space, and many theorems are of this character.\u000aThe term compact set is sometimes a synonym for compact space, but usually refers to a compact subspace of a topological space.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Historical development ==\u000aIn the 19th century, several disparate mathematical properties were understood that would later be seen as consequences of compactness. On the one hand, Bernard Bolzano (1817) had been aware that any bounded sequence of points (in the line or plane, for instance) has a subsequence that must eventually get arbitrarily close to some other point, called a limit point. Bolzano's proof relied on the method of bisection: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected. The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point. The full significance of Bolzano's theorem, and its method of proof, would not emerge until almost 50 years later when it was rediscovered by Karl Weierstrass.\u000aIn the 1880s, it became clear that results similar to the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem could be formulated for spaces of functions rather than just numbers or geometrical points. The idea of regarding functions as themselves points of a generalized space dates back to the investigations of Giulio Ascoli and Cesare Arzelà. The culmination of their investigations, the Arzelà\u2013Ascoli theorem, was a generalization of the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem to families of continuous functions, the precise conclusion of which was that it was possible to extract a uniformly convergent sequence of functions from a suitable family of functions. The uniform limit of this sequence then played precisely the same role as Bolzano's "limit point". Towards the beginning of the twentieth century, results similar to that of Arzelà and Ascoli began to accumulate in the area of integral equations, as investigated by David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt. For a certain class of Green functions coming from solutions of integral equations, Schmidt had shown that a property analogous to the Arzelà\u2013Ascoli theorem held in the sense of mean convergence\u2014or convergence in what would later be dubbed a Hilbert space. This ultimately led to the notion of a compact operator as an offshoot of the general notion of a compact space. It was Maurice Fréchet who, in 1906, had distilled the essence of the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass property and coined the term compactness to refer to this general phenomenon (he used the term already in his 1904 paper which led to the famous 1906 thesis) .\u000aHowever, a different notion of compactness altogether had also slowly emerged at the end of the 19th century from the study of the continuum, which was seen as fundamental for the rigorous formulation of analysis. In 1870, Eduard Heine showed that a continuous function defined on a closed and bounded interval was in fact uniformly continuous. In the course of the proof, he made use of a lemma that from any countable cover of the interval by smaller open intervals, it was possible to select a finite number of these that also covered it. The significance of this lemma was recognized by Émile Borel (1895), and it was generalized to arbitrary collections of intervals by Pierre Cousin (1895) and Henri Lebesgue (1904). The Heine\u2013Borel theorem, as the result is now known, is another special property possessed by closed and bounded sets of real numbers.\u000aThis property was significant because it allowed for the passage from local information about a set (such as the continuity of a function) to global information about the set (such as the uniform continuity of a function). This sentiment was expressed by Lebesgue (1904), who also exploited it in the development of the integral now bearing his name. Ultimately the Russian school of point-set topology, under the direction of Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn, formulated Heine\u2013Borel compactness in a way that could be applied to the modern notion of a topological space. Alexandrov & Urysohn (1929) showed that the earlier version of compactness due to Fréchet, now called (relative) sequential compactness, under appropriate conditions followed from the version of compactness that was formulated in terms of the existence of finite subcovers. It was this notion of compactness that became the dominant one, because it was not only a stronger property, but it could be formulated in a more general setting with a minimum of additional technical machinery, as it relied only on the structure of the open sets in a space.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Basic examples ==\u000aAn example of a compact space is the unit interval [0,1] of real numbers. If one chooses an infinite number of distinct points in the unit interval, then there must be some accumulation point in that interval. For instance, the odd-numbered terms of the sequence 1,\u20091/2,\u20091/3,\u20093/4,\u20091/5,\u20095/6,\u20091/7,\u20097/8,\u2009\u2026 get arbitrarily close to 0, while the even-numbered ones get arbitrarily close to 1. The given example sequence shows the importance of including the boundary points of the interval, since the limit points must be in the space itself \u2014 an open (or half-open) interval of the real numbers is not compact. It is also crucial that the interval be bounded, since in the interval [0,\u221e) one could choose the sequence of points 0,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u2009\u2026, of which no sub-sequence ultimately gets arbitrarily close to any given real number.\u000aIn two dimensions, closed disks are compact since for any infinite number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary. However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior. Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point within the space. Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of equally-spaced points in any given direction without approaching any point.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Definitions ==\u000aVarious definitions of compactness may apply, depending on the level of generality. A subset of Euclidean space in particular is called compact if it is closed and bounded. This implies, by the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem, that any infinite sequence from the set has a subsequence that converges to a point in the set. Various equivalent notions of compactness, such as sequential compactness and limit point compactness, can be developed in general metric spaces.\u000aIn general topological spaces, however, the different notions of compactness are not equivalent, and the most useful notion of compactness\u2014originally called bicompactness\u2014is defined using covers consisting of open sets (see Open cover definition below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space is known as the Heine\u2013Borel theorem. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known locally\u2014in a neighbourhood of each point of the space\u2014and to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space. An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is uniformly continuous; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding global property.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Open cover definition ===\u000aFormally, a topological space X is called compact if each of its open covers has a finite subcover. Otherwise, it is called non-compact. Explicitly, this means that for every arbitrary collection\u000a\u000aof open subsets of X such that\u000a\u000athere is a finite subset J of A such that\u000a\u000aSome branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, typically influenced by the French school of Bourbaki, use the term quasi-compact for the general notion, and reserve the term compact for topological spaces that are both Hausdorff and quasi-compact. A compact set is sometimes referred to as a compactum, plural compacta.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Equivalent definitions ===\u000aAssuming the axiom of choice, the following are equivalent:\u000aA topological space X is compact.\u000aEvery open cover of X has a finite subcover.\u000aX has a sub-base such that every cover of the space by members of the sub-base has a finite subcover (Alexander's sub-base theorem)\u000aAny collection of closed subsets of X with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection.\u000aEvery net on X has a convergent subnet (see the article on nets for a proof).\u000aEvery filter on X has a convergent refinement.\u000aEvery ultrafilter on X converges to at least one point.\u000aEvery infinite subset of X has a complete accumulation point.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Euclidean space ====\u000aFor any subset A of Euclidean space Rn, A is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded; this is the Heine\u2013Borel theorem.\u000aAs a Euclidean space is a metric space, the conditions in the next subsection also apply to all of its subsets. Of all of the equivalent conditions, it is in practice easiest to verify that a subset is closed and bounded, for example, for a closed interval or closed n-ball.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Metric spaces ====\u000aFor any metric space (X,d), the following are equivalent:\u000a(X,d) is compact.\u000a(X,d) is complete and totally bounded (this is also equivalent to compactness for uniform spaces).\u000a(X,d) is sequentially compact; that is, every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in X (this is also equivalent to compactness for first-countable uniform spaces).\u000a(X,d) is limit point compact; that is, every infinite subset of X has at least one limit point in X.\u000a(X,d) is an image of a continuous function from the Cantor set.\u000aA compact metric space (X,d) also satisfies the following properties:\u000aLebesgue's number lemma: For every open cover of X, there exists a number \u03b4 > 0 such that every subset of X of diameter < \u03b4 is contained in some member of the cover.\u000a(X,d) is second-countable, separable and Lindelöf \u2013 these three conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The converse is not true; e.g., a countable discrete space satisfies these three conditions, but is not compact.\u000aX is closed and bounded (as a subset of any metric space whose restricted metric is d). The converse may fail for a non-Euclidean space; e.g. the real line equipped with the discrete topology is closed and bounded but not compact, as the collection of all singleton points of the space is an open cover which admits no finite subcover. It is complete but not totally bounded.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Characterization by continuous functions ====\u000aLet X be a topological space and C(X) the ring of real continuous functions on X. For each p\u2208X, the evaluation map\u000a\u000agiven by evp(f)=f(p) is a ring homomorphism. The kernel of evp is a maximal ideal, since the residue field C(X)/ker evp is the field of real numbers, by the first isomorphism theorem. A topological space X is pseudocompact if and only if every maximal ideal in C(X) has residue field the real numbers. For completely regular spaces, this is equivalent to every maximal ideal being the kernel of an evaluation homomorphism. There are pseudocompact spaces that are not compact, though.\u000aIn general, for non-pseudocompact spaces there are always maximal ideals m in C(X) such that the residue field C(X)/m is a (non-archimedean) hyperreal field. The framework of non-standard analysis allows for the following alternative characterization of compactness: a topological space X is compact if and only if every point x of the natural extension *X is infinitely close to a point x0 of X (more precisely, x is contained in the monad of x0).\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Hyperreal definition ====\u000aA space X is compact if its natural extension *X (for example, an ultrapower) has the property that every point of *X is infinitely close to a suitable point of . For example, an open real interval X=(0,1) is not compact because its hyperreal extension *(0,1) contains infinitesimals, which are infinitely close to 0, which is not a point of X.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Compactness of subspaces ===\u000aA subset K of a topological space X is called compact if it is compact as a subspace. Explicitly, this means that for every arbitrary collection\u000a\u000aof open subsets of X such that\u000a\u000athere is a finite subset J of A such that\u000a\u000a\u000a== Properties of compact spaces ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Functions and compact spaces ===\u000aA continuous image of a compact space is compact. This implies the extreme value theorem: a continuous real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum. (Slightly more generally, this is true for an upper semicontinuous function.) As a sort of converse to the above statements, the pre-image of a compact space under a proper map is compact.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Compact spaces and set operations ===\u000aA closed subset of a compact space is compact., and a finite union of compact sets is compact.\u000aThe product of any collection of compact spaces is compact. (Tychonoff's theorem, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice)\u000aEvery topological space X is an open dense subspace of a compact space having at most one point more than X, by the Alexandroff one-point compactification. By the same construction, every locally compact Hausdorff space X is an open dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space having at most one point more than X.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Ordered compact spaces ===\u000aA nonempty compact subset of the real numbers has a greatest element and a least element.\u000aLet X be a simply ordered set endowed with the order topology. Then X is compact if and only if X is a complete lattice (i.e. all subsets have suprema and infima).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Examples ==\u000aAny finite topological space, including the empty set, is compact. More generally, any space with a finite topology (only finitely many open sets) is compact; this includes in particular the trivial topology.\u000aAny space carrying the cofinite topology is compact.\u000aAny locally compact Hausdorff space can be turned into a compact space by adding a single point to it, by means of Alexandroff one-point compactification. The one-point compactification of R is homeomorphic to the circle S1; the one-point compactification of R2 is homeomorphic to the sphere S2. Using the one-point compactification, one can also easily construct compact spaces which are not Hausdorff, by starting with a non-Hausdorff space.\u000aThe right order topology or left order topology on any bounded totally ordered set is compact. In particular, Sierpinski space is compact.\u000aR, carrying the lower limit topology, satisfies the property that no uncountable set is compact.\u000aIn the cocountable topology on an uncountable set, no infinite set is compact. Like the previous example, the space as a whole is not locally compact but is still Lindelöf.\u000aThe closed unit interval [0,1] is compact. This follows from the Heine\u2013Borel theorem. The open interval (0,1) is not compact: the open cover\u000a\u000afor n = 3,\u20094,\u2009\u2026\u2009 does not have a finite subcover. Similarly, the set of rational numbers in the closed interval [0,1] is not compact: the sets of rational numbers in the intervals\u000a\u000acover all the rationals in [0, 1] for n = 4,\u20095,\u2009\u2026\u2009 but this cover does not have a finite subcover. (Note that the sets are open in the subspace topology even though they are not open as subsets of R.)\u000aThe set R of all real numbers is not compact as there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals (n\u22121,\u2009n+1)\u2009, where n takes all integer values in Z, cover R but there is no finite subcover.\u000aFor every natural number n, the n-sphere is compact. Again from the Heine\u2013Borel theorem, the closed unit ball of any finite-dimensional normed vector space is compact. This is not true for infinite dimensions; in fact, a normed vector space is finite-dimensional if and only if its closed unit ball is compact.\u000aOn the other hand, the closed unit ball of the dual of a normed space is compact for the weak-* topology. (Alaoglu's theorem)\u000aThe Cantor set is compact. In fact, every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set.\u000aConsider the set K of all functions f : R \u2192 [0,1] from the real number line to the closed unit interval, and define a topology on K so that a sequence  in K converges towards  if and only if  converges towards f(x) for all real numbers x. There is only one such topology; it is called the topology of pointwise convergence or the product topology. Then K is a compact topological space; this follows from the Tychonoff theorem.\u000aConsider the set K of all functions f : [0,1] \u2192 [0,1] satisfying the Lipschitz condition |f(x) \u2212 f(y)| \u2264 |x \u2212 y| for all x, y \u2208 [0,1]. Consider on K\u2009 the metric induced by the uniform distance\u000a\u000aThen by Arzelà\u2013Ascoli theorem the space K is compact.\u000aThe spectrum of any bounded linear operator on a Banach space is a nonempty compact subset of the complex numbers C. Conversely, any compact subset of C arises in this manner, as the spectrum of some bounded linear operator. For instance, a diagonal operator on the Hilbert space  may have any compact nonempty subset of C as spectrum.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Algebraic examples ===\u000aCompact groups such as an orthogonal group are compact, while groups such as a general linear group are not.\u000aSince the p-adic integers are homeomorphic to the Cantor set, they form a compact set.\u000aThe spectrum of any commutative ring with the Zariski topology (that is, the set of all prime ideals) is compact, but never Hausdorff (except in trivial cases). In algebraic geometry, such topological spaces are examples of quasi-compact schemes, "quasi" referring to the non-Hausdorff nature of the topology.\u000aThe spectrum of a Boolean algebra is compact, a fact which is part of the Stone representation theorem. Stone spaces, compact totally disconnected Hausdorff spaces, form the abstract framework in which these spectra are studied. Such spaces are also useful in the study of profinite groups.\u000aThe structure space of a commutative unital Banach algebra is a compact Hausdorff space.\u000aThe Hilbert cube is compact, again a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem.\u000aA profinite group (e.g., Galois group) is compact.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aCompactly generated space\u000aEberlein compactum\u000aExhaustion by compact sets\u000aLindelöf space\u000aMetacompact space\u000aNoetherian space\u000aOrthocompact space\u000aParacompact space\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aAlexandrov, Pavel; Urysohn, Pavel (1929), "Mémoire sur les espaces topologiques compacts", Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam, Proceedings of the section of mathematical sciences 14 .\u000aArkhangel'skii, A.V.; Fedorchuk, V.V.

VV( named vee /\u02c8vi\u02d0/, or long-u /\u02c8l\u0252\u014bju\u02d0/,) is the 22nd letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.\u000a\u000a\u000a== History ==\u000a\u000aThe letter V comes from the Semitic letter Waw, as do the modern letters F, U, W, and Y. See F for details.\u000aIn Greek, the letter upsilon '\u03a5' was adapted from waw to represent, at first, the vowel [u] as in "moon". This was later fronted to [y], the front rounded vowel spelled 'ü' in German.\u000aIn Latin, a stemless variant shape of the upsilon was borrowed in early times as V\u2014either directly from the Western Greek alphabet or from the Etruscan alphabet as an intermediary\u2014to represent the same /u/ sound, as well as the consonantal /w/. Thus, 'num' \u2014 originally spelled 'NVM' \u2014 was pronounced /num/ and 'via' was pronounced [\u02c8wia]. From the 1st century AD on, depending on Vulgar Latin dialect, consonantal /w/ developed into /\u03b2/ (kept in Spanish), then later to /v/.\u000aIn Roman numerals, the letter 'V' is used to represent the number 5. It was used because it resembled the convention of counting by notches carved in wood, with every fifth notch double-cut to form a 'V'.\u000aDuring the Late Middle Ages, two forms of 'v' developed, which were both used for its ancestor /u/ and modern /v/. The pointed form 'v' was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form 'u' was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas 'valor' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed as 'haue' and 'vpon'. The first distinction between the letters 'u' and 'v' is recorded in a Gothic script from 1386, where 'v' preceded 'u'. By the mid-16th century, the 'v' form was used to represent the consonant and 'u' the vowel sound, giving us the modern letter 'u'. Capital 'U' was not accepted as a distinct letter until many years later.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Letter ==\u000aIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, /v/ represents the voiced labiodental fricative. See Help:IPA.\u000aIn English, V is unusual in that it has not traditionally been doubled to indicate a short vowel, the way for example P is doubled to indicate the difference between 'super' and 'supper'. However, that is changing with newly coined words, such as 'divvy up' and 'skivvies'. Like J, K, Q, X, and Z, V is not used very frequently in English. It is the 6th least common letter in the English language, with a frequency of about 1.03% in words. V is the only letter that cannot be used to form an English two-letter word in the Australian version of the game of Scrabble. C also cannot be used in the American version\u000aThe letter appears frequently in the Romance languages, where it is the first letter of the second person plural pronoun and (in Italian) the stem of the imperfect form of most verbs.\u000aThis letter, like Q and X, is not used in the Polish alphabet. /v/ is spelled with the letter \u27e8w\u27e9 instead, following the convention of German.\u000aInformal romanizations of Mandarin Chinese use V as a substitute for the close front rounded vowel /y/, properly written ü or ue in pinyin and ueh in Wade-Giles.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other names ==\u000aCatalan: ve, pronounced [\u02c8ve]; in dialects that lack contrast between /v/ and /b/, the letter is called ve baixa [\u02c8be \u02c8baj\u0283\u0259] "low B/V".\u000aCzech: vé [v\u025b\u02d0]\u000aFrench: vé [ve]\u000aGerman: fau [\u02c8fa\u028a]\u000aItalian: vu [\u02c8vu] or vi [\u02c8vi]\u000aPortuguese: vê [\u02c8ve]\u000aSpanish: uve [\u02c8u\u03b2e] is recommended, but ve [\u02c8be] is traditional. If V is pronounced in the second way, it would have the same pronunciation as the letter B in Spanish (i.e. [\u02c8be] after pause or nasal sound, otherwise [\u02c8\u03b2e]); thus further terms are needed to distinguish ve from be. In some countries it is called ve corta, ve baja, ve pequeña, ve chica or ve labiodental.\u000aIn Japanese, V is often called "bui" (\u30d6\u30a4). This name is an approximation of the English name which substitutes the voiced bilabial plosive for the voiced labiodental fricative (which does not exist in native Japanese phonology) and differentiates it from "b\u012b" (\u30d3\u30fc), the Japanese name of the letter B. The sound can be written with the relatively recently developed katakana character \u300c\u30f4\u300d (vu) va, vi, vu, ve, vo (\u30f4\u30a1, \u30f4\u30a3, \u30f4, \u30f4\u30a7, \u30f4\u30a9), though in practice the pronunciation is usually not the strictly labiodental fricative found in English. Moreover, some words are more often spelled with the b equivalent character instead of vu due to the long-time use of the word without it (e.g. "violin" is more often found as baiorin (\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3) than as vaiorin (\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3) due partly to inertia, and to some extent due to the more native Japanese sound).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Pronunciation ==\u000aIn most languages which use a Latin alphabet, \u27e8v\u27e9 has a [v]-like sound (voiced labiodental fricative). In most dialects of Spanish, it is pronounced the same as \u27e8b\u27e9, that is, [b] or [\u03b2\u031e]. In Corsican, it is pronounced [b], [v], [\u03b2] or [w], depending on the position in the word and the sentence. In German and Dutch it can be either [v] or [f].\u000aIn Native American languages of North America (mainly Iroquoian), \u27e8v\u27e9 represents a nasalized central vowel, /\u0259\u0303/.\u000aIn Chinese pinyin, \u27e8v\u27e9 is not used, as there is no sound [v] in Standard Mandarin; but the letter \u27e8v\u27e9 is used by most input methods to enter letter \u27e8ü\u27e9, which most keyboards lack. Romanised Chinese is a popular method to enter Chinese text phonetically.\u000aIn Irish, the letter \u27e8v\u27e9 is mostly used in loanwords, such as veidhlín from English violin. However the sound [v] appears naturally in Irish when /b/ is lenited or "softened", represented in the orthography by \u27e8bh\u27e9, so that bhí is pronounced [v\u02b2i\u02d0], an bhean (the woman) is pronounced [\u0259n\u032a\u02e0 \u02c8v\u02b2an\u032a\u02e0], etc.\u000aIn the 19th century, \u27e8v\u27e9 was sometimes used to transcribe a palatal click, [\u01c2], a function since partly taken over by \u27e8ç\u27e9.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Related letters and other similar characters ==\u000a\U00010905: Phoenician letter waw, the ancestral glyph\u000a\u03a5 \u03c5 : Greek letter upsilon, from which V is descended\u000a\u0423 \u0443 : Cyrillic letter u, descended from upsilon\u000aY y : Latin letter Y, which, like V, is also descended from upsilon\u000aU u : Latin letter U, descended from V\u000aW w : Latin letter W, also descended from V\u000a\u0474 \u0475 : Cyrillic letter izhitsa, a letter of the early Cyrillic alphabet\u000a\u039d \u03bd : Greek letter nu, which appears like a "v" in lowercase\u000a\u054e \u057e : \u054e from Armenian alphabet\u000a\u000a\u000a== Computing codes ==\u000a1 Also for encodings based on ASCII, including the DOS, Windows, ISO-8859 and Macintosh families of encodings.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Other representations ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aDominant, in music theory\u000aVee\u000a\u2228, logical disjunction\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a Media related to V at Wikimedia Commons\u000a The dictionary definition of V at Wiktionary\u000a The dictionary definition of v at Wiktionary

VThe Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. It is not, as its name might suggest, in Cancer. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\u000aAt an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn's moon Titan, it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% c.\u000aAt the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28\u201330 kilometres (17\u201319 mi) across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab is generally the strongest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula's radiation allows for the detailed studying of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's corona was mapped from observations of the Crab's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Observational history ==\u000a\u000aModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova dates to 1921, when Carl Otto Lampland announced he had seen changes in its structure. This eventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright SN 1054 supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in AD 1054, but virtually unrecorded in Islamic texts. There is also a 13th-century Japanese reference to this "guest star" in Meigetsuki.\u000aThe event was long considered unrecorded in Islamic astronomy, but in 1978 a reference was found in a 13th-century copy made by Ibn Abi Usaibia of a work by Ibn Butlan, a Nestorian Christian physician active in Baghdad.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== First identification ===\u000a\u000aThe Crab Nebula was first identified in 1731 by John Bevis. The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier as he was observing a bright comet. Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet-like objects; in 1757, Alexis Clairaut reexamined the calculations of Edmund Halley and predicted the return of Halley's Comet in late 1758. The exact time of the comet's return required the consideration of perturbations to its orbit caused by planets in the Solar System such as Jupiter, which Clairaut and his two colleagues Jérôme Lalande and Nicole-Reine Lepaute carried out more precisely than Halley, finding that the comet should appear in the constellation of Taurus. It is in searching in vain for the comet that Charles Messier found the Crab nebula, which he at first thought to be Halley's comet. After some observation, noticing that the object that he was observing was not moving across the sky, Messier concluded that the object was not a comet. Messier then realised the usefulness of compiling a catalogue of celestial objects of a cloudy nature, but fixed in the sky, to avoid incorrectly cataloguing them as comets.\u000aWilliam Herschel observed the Crab Nebula numerous times between 1783 and 1809, but it is not known whether he was aware of its existence in 1783, or if he discovered it independently of Messier and Bevis. After several observations, he concluded that it was composed of a group of stars. The 3rd Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in 1844 using a 36-inch (0.9 m) telescope, and referred to the object as the "Crab Nebula" because a drawing he made of it looked like a crab. He observed it again later, in 1848, using a 72-inch (1.8 m) telescope and could not confirm the supposed resemblance, but the name stuck nevertheless.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Connection to SN 1054 ===\u000aIn 1913, when Vesto Slipher registered his spectroscopy study of the sky, the Crab nebula was again one of the first objects to be studied. In the early twentieth century, the analysis of early photographs of the nebula taken several years apart revealed that it was expanding. Tracing the expansion back revealed that the nebula must have become visible on Earth about 900 years ago. Historical records revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers in 1054.\u000aChanges in the cloud, suggesting its small extent, were discovered by Carl Lampland in 1921. That same year, John Charles Duncan demonstrated that the remnant is expanding, while Knut Lundmark noted its proximity to the guest star of 1054,\u000aIn 1928, Edwin Hubble proposed associating the cloud to the star of 1054, an idea which remained confidential until the nature of supernovae was understood, and it was Nicholas Mayall who indicated that the star of 1054 was undoubtedly the supernova whose explosion produced the Crab Nebula. The search for historical supernovae started at that moment: seven other historical sightings have been found by comparing modern observations of supernova remnants with astronomical documents of past centuries. Given its great distance, the daytime "guest star" observed by the Chinese could only have been a supernova\u2014a massive, exploding star, having exhausted its supply of energy from nuclear fusion and collapsed in on itself.\u000aRecent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude \u22127 and \u22124.5 (brighter than everything in the night sky except the Moon) by July. The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation. Thanks to the recorded observations of Far Eastern and Middle Eastern astronomers of 1054, Crab Nebula became the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Crab Pulsar ===\u000a\u000aIn the 1960s, because of the prediction and discovery of pulsars, the Crab nebula again became a major centre of interest. It was then that Franco Pacini predicted the existence of the Crab Pulsar for the first time, which would explain the brightness of the cloud. The star was observed shortly afterwards in 1968. The discovery of the Crab pulsar, and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The role of this supernova to the scientific understanding of supernova remnants was crucial, as no other historical supernova created a pulsar whose precise age we can know for certain. The only possible exception to this rule would be SN 1181 whose supposed remnant, 3C 58, is home to a pulsar, but its identification using Chinese observations from 1181 is sometimes contested.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Physical conditions ==\u000a\u000aIn visible light, the Crab Nebula consists of a broadly oval-shaped mass of filaments, about 6 arcminutes long and 4 arcminutes wide (by comparison, the full moon is 30 arcminutes across) surrounding a diffuse blue central region. In three dimensions, the nebula is thought to be shaped like a prolate spheroid. The filaments are the remnants of the progenitor star's atmosphere, and consist largely of ionised helium and hydrogen, along with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon and sulfur. The filaments' temperatures are typically between 11,000 and 18,000 K, and their densities are about 1,300 particles per cm3.\u000aIn 1953 Iosif Shklovsky proposed that the diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by the curving motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light. Three years later the theory was confirmed by observations. In the 1960s it was found that the source of the curved paths of the electrons was the strong magnetic field produced by a neutron star at the centre of the nebula.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Distance ===\u000aEven though the Crab Nebula is the focus of much attention among astronomers, its distance remains an open question, owing to uncertainties in every method used to estimate its distance. In 2008, the consensus was that its distance from Earth is 2.0 ± 0.5 kpc (6,500 ± 1,600 ly). Along its longest visible dimension, it thus measures about 4.1 ± 1 pc (13 ± 3 ly) across.\u000aThe Crab Nebula currently is expanding outward at about 1,500 km/s (930 mi/s). Images taken several years apart reveal the slow expansion of the nebula, and by comparing this angular expansion with its spectroscopically determined expansion velocity, the nebula's distance can be estimated. In 1973, an analysis of many methods used to compute the distance to the nebula had reached a conclusion of about 1.9 kpc (6,300 ly), consistent with the currently cited value.\u000aThe Crab Pulsar itself was discovered in 1968. Tracing back its expansion (assuming a constant decrease of expansion speed due to the nebula's mass) yielded a date for the creation of the nebula several decades after 1054, implying that its outward velocity has decelerated less than assumed since the supernova explosion. This reduced deceleration is believed to be caused by energy from the pulsar that feeds into the nebula's magnetic field, which expands and forces the nebula's filaments outward.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Mass ===\u000aEstimates of the total mass of the nebula are important for estimating the mass of the supernova's progenitor star. The amount of matter contained in the Crab Nebula's filaments (ejecta mass of ionized and neutral gas; mostly helium) is estimated to be 7030914986000000000\u26604.6±1.8 M\u2609.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Helium-rich torus ===\u000aOne of the many nebular components (or anomalies) of the Crab is a helium-rich torus which is visible as an east-west band crossing the pulsar region. The torus composes about 25% of the visible ejecta. However, it is suggested by calculation that about 95% of the torus is helium. As yet, there has been no plausible explanation put forth for the structure of the torus.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Central star ==\u000a\u000aAt the centre of the Crab Nebula are two faint stars, one of which is the star responsible for the existence of the nebula. It was identified as such in 1942, when Rudolf Minkowski found that its optical spectrum was extremely unusual. The region around the star was found to be a strong source of radio waves in 1949 and X-rays in 1963, and was identified as one of the brightest objects in the sky in gamma rays in 1967. Then, in 1968, the star was found to be emitting its radiation in rapid pulses, becoming one of the first pulsars to be discovered.\u000aPulsars are sources of powerful electromagnetic radiation, emitted in short and extremely regular pulses many times a second. They were a great mystery when discovered in 1967, and the team who identified the first one considered the possibility that it could be a signal from an advanced civilization. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. They now are understood to be rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose powerful magnetic field concentrates their radiation emissions into narrow beams.\u000aThe Crab Pulsar is believed to be about 28\u201330 km (17\u201319 mi) in diameter; it emits pulses of radiation every 33 milliseconds. Pulses are emitted at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. Like all isolated pulsars, its period is slowing very gradually. Occasionally, its rotational period shows sharp changes, known as 'glitches', which are believed to be caused by a sudden realignment inside the neutron star. The energy released as the pulsar slows down is enormous, and it powers the emission of the synchrotron radiation of the Crab Nebula, which has a total luminosity about 75,000 times greater than that of the Sun.\u000aThe pulsar's extreme energy output creates an unusually dynamic region at the centre of the Crab Nebula. While most astronomical objects evolve so slowly that changes are visible only over timescales of many years, the inner parts of the Crab show changes over timescales of only a few days. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar's equatorial wind slams into the bulk of the nebula, forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into the main body of the nebula.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Progenitor star ==\u000a\u000aThe star that exploded as a supernova is referred to as the supernova's progenitor star. Two types of stars explode as supernovae: white dwarfs and massive stars. In the so-called Type Ia supernovae, gases falling onto a white dwarf raise its mass until it nears a critical level, the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in an explosion; in Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae, the progenitor star is a massive star which runs out of fuel to power its nuclear fusion reactions and collapses in on itself, reaching such phenomenal temperatures that it explodes. The presence of a pulsar in the Crab means that it must have formed in a core-collapse supernova; Type Ia supernovae do not produce pulsars.\u000aTheoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the star that exploded to produce the Crab Nebula must have had a mass of between 9 and 11 M\u2609. Stars with masses lower than 8 M\u2609 are thought to be too small to produce supernova explosions, and end their lives by producing a planetary nebula instead, while a star heavier than 12 M\u2609 would have produced a nebula with a different chemical composition to that observed in the Crab. Recent studies, however, suggest the progenitor could have been a super-Asymptotic giant branch star that would have exploded in an electron-capture supernova.\u000aA significant problem in studies of the Crab Nebula is that the combined mass of the nebula and the pulsar add up to considerably less than the predicted mass of the progenitor star, and the question of where the 'missing mass' is, remains unresolved. Estimates of the mass of the nebula are made by measuring the total amount of light emitted, and calculating the mass required, given the measured temperature and density of the nebula. Estimates range from about 1\u20135 M\u2609, with 2\u20133 M\u2609 being the generally accepted value. The neutron star mass is estimated to be between 1.4 and 2 M\u2609.\u000aThe predominant theory to account for the missing mass of the Crab is that a substantial proportion of the mass of the progenitor was carried away before the supernova explosion in a fast stellar wind, a phenomenon commonly seen in Wolf-Rayet stars. However, this would have created a shell around the nebula. Although attempts have been made at several wavelengths to observe a shell, none has yet been found.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Transits by Solar System bodies ==\u000a\u000aThe Crab Nebula lies roughly 1.5 degrees away from the ecliptic\u2014the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This means that the Moon\u2014and occasionally, planets\u2014can transit or occult the nebula. Although the Sun does not transit the nebula, its corona passes in front of it. These transits and occultations can be used to analyse both the nebula and the object passing in front of it, by observing how radiation from the nebula is altered by the transiting body.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Lunar ===\u000aLunar transits have been used to map X-ray emissions from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray observations generally had quite low angular resolution, but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula's brightness can be used to create maps of X-ray emission. When X-rays were first observed from the Crab, a lunar occultation was used to determine the exact location of their source.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Solar ===\u000aThe Sun's corona passes in front of the Crab every June. Variations in the radio waves received from the Crab at this time can be used to infer details about the corona's density and structure. Early observations established that the corona extended out to much greater distances than had previously been thought; later observations found that the corona contained substantial density variations.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Other objects ===\u000aVery rarely, Saturn transits the Crab Nebula. Its transit in 2003 was the first since 1296; another will not occur until 2267. Observers used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe Saturn's moon Titan as it crossed the nebula, and found that Titan's X-ray 'shadow' was larger than its solid surface, due to absorption of X-rays in its atmosphere. These observations showed that the thickness of Titan's atmosphere is 880 km (550 mi). The transit of Saturn itself could not be observed, because Chandra was passing through the Van Allen belts at the time.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000aCrab Nebula in fiction\u000aList of nebulae\u000a\u000a\u000a== Notes ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aCrab Nebula on WikiSky: DSS2, SDSS, GALEX, IRAS, Hydrogen \u03b1, X-Ray, Astrophoto, Sky Map, Articles and images\u000aCrab Nebula in the University of Cambridge Catalogue of Galactic Supernova Remnants\u000aCrab Nebula in the SEDS Messier index\u000aCrab Nebula in the Chandra X-ray Observatory Field Guide series\u000aCrab Nebula images by the Hubble Space Telescope

VInterferometry is a family of techniques in which waves, usually electromagnetic, are superimposed in order to extract information about the waves. Interferometry is an important investigative technique in the fields of astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, and velocimetry.\u000aInterferometers are widely used in science and industry for the measurement of small displacements, refractive index changes and surface irregularities. In analytical science, interferometers are used in continuous wave Fourier transform spectroscopy to analyze light containing features of absorption or emission associated with a substance or mixture. An astronomical interferometer consists of two or more separate telescopes that combine their signals, offering a resolution equivalent to that of a telescope of diameter equal to the largest separation between its individual elements.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Basic principles ==\u000a\u000aInterferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves\u2014waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.\u000aTypically (see Fig. 1, the well-known Michelson configuration) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). Each of these beams travels a different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a detector. The path difference, the difference in the distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. If a single beam has been split along two paths, then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths. This could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.\u000aAs seen in Fig. 2a and 2b, the observer has a direct view of mirror M1 seen through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image M'2 of mirror M2. The fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images S'1 and S'2 of the original source S. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In Fig. 2a, the optical elements are oriented so that S'1 and S'2 are in line with the observer, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to M1 and M'2. If, as in Fig. 2b, M1 and M'2 are tilted with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if M1 and M'2 overlap, the fringes near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced. If S is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of Fig. 2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of Fig. 2b will be localized on the mirrors.\u000aUse of white light will result in a pattern of colored fringes (see Fig. 3). The central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system. (See Michelson interferometer for a discussion of this.)\u000a\u000a\u000a== Categories ==\u000aInterferometers and interferometric techniques may be categorized by a variety of criteria:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Homodyne versus heterodyne detection ===\u000aIn homodyne detection, the interference occurs between two beams at the same wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.\u000aThe heterodyne technique is used for (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1 + f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1 \u2212 f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.\u000aThe most important and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which is sent to the loudspeaker.\u000aOptical heterodyne detection is an extension of the heterodyne technique to higher (visible) frequencies.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Double path versus common path ===\u000a\u000aA double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths. Examples include the Michelson interferometer, the Twyman-Green interferometer, and the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. After being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test, the sample beam is recombined with the reference beam to create an interference pattern which can then be interpreted.\u000aA common path interferometer is a class of interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig. 4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. Other examples of common path interferometer include the Zernike phase contrast microscope, Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Wavefront splitting versus amplitude splitting ===\u000aA wavefront splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront emerging from a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the two parts of the wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig. 5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.\u000a\u000aIn 1803, Young's interference experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. If white light is used in Young's experiment, the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits, surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity. In addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation, Young's experiment has been performed with individual photons, with electrons, and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope.\u000aLloyd's mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.\u000a\u000aAn amplitude splitting interferometer uses a partial reflector to divide the amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined. Fig. 6 illustrates the Fizeau, Mach\u2013Zehnder and Fabry\u2013Pérot interferometers. Other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the Michelson, Twyman\u2013Green, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik interferometer.\u000a\u000aThe Fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig 6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.\u000aThe Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer is a more versatile instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. As illustrated in Fig. 6, a compensating cell would be placed in the path of the reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.\u000aThe heart of the Fabry\u2013Pérot interferometer is a pair of partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry\u2013Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. in the absence of the paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig. 6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig. 6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.\u000a\u000aIt is interesting to note that Michelson and Morley (1887) and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether, used monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment, always switching to white light for the actual measurements. The reason is that measurements were recorded visually. Monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern. Lacking modern means of environmental temperature control, experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even though the interferometer might be set up in a basement. Since the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations by passing horse traffic, distant thunderstorms and the like, it would be easy for an observer to "get lost" when the fringes returned to visibility. The advantages of white light, which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern, far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length. This was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the "2 pi ambiguity".\u000a\u000a\u000a== Applications ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Physics and astronomy ===\u000aIn physics, one of the most important experiments of the late 19th century was the famous "failed experiment" of Michelson and Morley that served as an inspiration for special relativity. Recent repetitions of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment perform heterodyne measurements of beat frequencies of crossed cryogenic optical resonators. Fig 7 illustrates a resonator experiment performed by Müller et al. in 2003. Two optical resonators constructed from crystalline sapphire, controlling the frequencies of two lasers, were set at right angles within a helium cryostat. A frequency comparator measured the beat frequency of the combined outputs of the two resonators. As of 2009, the precision by which anisotropy of the speed of light can be excluded in resonator experiments is at the 10\u221217 level.\u000a\u000aMichelson interferometers are used in tunable narrow band optical filters and as the core hardware component of Fourier transform spectrometers.\u000aWhen used as a tunable narrow band filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of advantages and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry\u2013Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry\u2013Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.\u000aFig. 8 illustrates the operation of a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.\u000aFig. 9 shows a doppler image of the solar corona made using a tunable Fabry-Pérot interferometer to recover scans of the solar corona at a number of wavelengths near the FeXIV green line. The picture is a color-coded image of the doppler shift of the line, which may be associated with the coronal plasma velocity towards or away from the satellite camera.\u000aFabry-Pérot thin-film etalons are used in narrow bandpass filters capable of selecting a single spectral line for imaging; for example, the H-alpha line or the Ca-K line of the Sun or stars. Fig. 10 shows an Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun at 195 Ångströms, corresponding to a spectral line of multiply-ionized iron atoms. EIT used multilayer coated reflective mirrors that were coated with alternate layers of a light "spacer" element (such as silicon), and a heavy "scatterer" element (such as molybdenum). Approximately 100 layers of each type were placed on each mirror, with a thickness of around 10 nm each. The layer thicknesses were tightly controlled so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer interfered constructively.\u000aThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the detection of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry\u2013Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser.\u000aThe Mach-Zehnder interferometer's relatively large and freely accessible working space, and its flexibility in locating the fringes has made it the interferometer of choice for visualizing flow in wind tunnels, and for flow visualization studies in general. It is frequently used in the fields of aerodynamics, plasma physics and heat transfer to measure pressure, density, and temperature changes in gases.\u000aMach-Zehnder interferometers are also used to study one of the most counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics, the phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.\u000a\u000aAn astronomical interferometer achieves high-resolution observations using the technique of aperture synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very expensive monolithic telescope.\u000aEarly radio telescope interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, such as the Very Large Array illustrated in Fig 11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using the rotation of the Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.\u000a\u000aAstronomical optical interferometry has had to overcome a number of technical issues not shared by radio telescope interferometry. The short wavelengths of light necessitate extreme precision and stability of construction. For example, spatial resolution of 1 milliarcsecond requires 0.5 µm stability in a 100 m baseline. Optical interferometric measurements require high sensitivity, low noise detectors that did not become available until the late 1990s. Astronomical "seeing", the turbulence that causes stars to twinkle, introduces rapid, random phase changes in the incoming light, requiring kilohertz data collection rates to be faster than the rate of turbulence. Despite these technical difficulties, roughly a dozen astronomical optical interferometers are now in operation offering resolutions down to the fractional milliarcsecond range. Fig. 12 shows a movie assembled from aperture sythesis images of the Beta Lyrae system, a binary star system approximately 960 light-years (290 parsecs) away in the constellation Lyra, as observed by the CHARA array with the MIRC instrument. The brighter component is the primary star, or the mass donor. The fainter component is the thick disk surrounding the secondary star, or the mass gainer. The two components are separated by 1 milli-arcsecond. Tidal distortions of the mass donor and the mass gainer are both clearly visible.\u000aThe wave character of matter can be exploited to build interferometers. The first examples of matter interferometers were electron interferometers, later followed by neutron interferometers. Around 1990 the first atom interferometers were demonstrated, later followed by interferometers employing molecules.\u000aElectron holography is an imaging technique that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, which is then reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.\u000aNeutron interferometry has been used to investigate the Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect, to examine the effects of gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.\u000aAtom interferometry techniques are reaching sufficient precision to allow laboratory-scale tests of general relativity.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Engineering and applied science ===\u000a\u000aNewton (test plate) interferometry is frequently used in the optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig. 13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats at different stages of completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.\u000aFabry-Perot etalons are widely used in telecommunications, lasers and spectroscopy to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that enables the use of multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.\u000a\u000aThe Twyman\u2013Green interferometer, invented by Twyman and Green in 1916, is a variant of the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It is interesting to note that Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig. 14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.\u000aMach-Zehnder interferometers are being used in integrated optical circuits, in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are externally modulated to vary their relative phase. A slight tilt of one of the beam splitters will result in a path difference and a change in the interference pattern. Mach-Zehnder interferometers are the basis of a wide variety of devices, from RF modulators to sensors to optical switches.\u000aThe latest proposed extremely large astronomical telescopes, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be built from hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference with the aid of a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig. 15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10 µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.\u000a\u000aRing laser gyroscopes (RLGs) and fibre optic gyroscopes (FOGs) are interferometers used in navigation systems. They operate on the principle of the Sagnac effect. The distinction between RLGs and FOGs is that in a RLG, the entire ring is part of the laser while in a FOG, an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an optical fiber ring, and rotation of the system then causes a relative phase shift between those beams. In a RLG, the observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation, while in a FOG, the observed phase shift is proportional to the angular velocity.\u000aIn telecommunication networks, heterodyning is used to move frequencies of individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels at the same time because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.\u000aOptical heterodyne detection is used for coherent Doppler lidar measurements capable of detecting very weak light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in optical fiber communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method can be used to measure the linewidth of a laser.\u000a\u000aOptical heterodyne detection is an essential technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, as well as in the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by heterodyne detection with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig. 16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.\u000aOne of the most common industrial applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), and Enhanced VSI (EVSI). These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. VSI uses white light and, rather than looking at the shape of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best focus position; it provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Different configurations of VSI may be used to measure macroscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the centimeter range, to microscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the micrometer range. EVSI represents a hybrid technique, using white light and measuring phase shifting.\u000a\u000aPhase Shifting Interferometry addresses several issues associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures the positions of the fringe centers. As seen in Fig. 13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig. 13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.\u000aPhase shifting interferometry overcomes these limitations by not relying on finding fringe centers, but rather by collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig. 17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted to a variety of interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach\u2013Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.\u000a\u000aVertical Scanning Interferometry (Scanning White Light Interferometry), also known by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry or CSI, is an example of low-coherence interferometry, which exploits the low coherence of white light. Interference will only be achieved when the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence time of the light source. VSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the shape of the fringes.\u000aFig. 17 illustrates a VSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt too much of the aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of low-coherence interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2 pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig. 18, which scans a 180\u03bcm x 140\u03bcm x 10\u03bcm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined by the coherence length of the light source and is typically in the micrometer range. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).\u000aFig. 19 illustrates a Twyman\u2013Green interferometer set up for white light scanning of a macroscopic object.\u000a\u000aHolographic interferometry is a technique which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, it is used to perform dimensional metrology of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.\u000aHolographic interometry was discovered by accident as a result of mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic plates were insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.\u000aEventually, several independent groups of experimenters in the mid-60s realized that the fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double exposures. The main Holographic interferometry article covers the disputes over priority of discovery that occurred during the issuance of the patent for this method.\u000aDouble- and multi- exposure holography is one of three methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.\u000aReal-time holography is a second method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.\u000aThe third method, time-average holography, involves creating a holograph while the object is subjected to a periodic stress or vibration. This yields a visual image of the vibration pattern.\u000a\u000aInterferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite synthetic aperture radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes that have taken place between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig 20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.\u000aElectronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), also known as TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce an image of the object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig. 21) The fringes are similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry.\u000aWhen lasers were first invented, laser speckle was considered to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.\u000aA method of establishing precise geodetic baselines, invented by Yrjö Väisälä, exploited the low coherence length of white light. Initially, white light was split in two, with the reference beam "folded", bouncing back-and-forth six times between a mirror pair spaced precisely 1 m apart. Only if the test path was precisely 6 times the reference path would fringes be seen. Repeated applications of this procedure allowed precise measurement of distances up to 864 meters. Baselines thus established were used to calibrate geodetic distance measurement equipment, leading to a metrologically traceable scale for geodetic networks measured by these instruments. (This method has been superseded by GPS.)\u000aOther uses of interferometers have been to study dispersion of materials, measurement of complex indices of refraction, and thermal properties. They are also used for three-dimensional motion mapping including mapping vibrational patterns of structures.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Biology and medicine ===\u000a\u000aOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig. 22, the core of a typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.\u000a\u000aPhase contrast and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs. 24 and 25, phase contrast and DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example in the analysis of planar silicon semiconductor processing.\u000aAngle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI) uses scattered light to measure the sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, it has been found that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.\u000aPhase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig. 26) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics and high resolution x-ray detectors.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aList of types of interferometers\u000aFizeau interferometer\u000aMichelson interferometer\u000aFabry\u2013Pérot interferometer\u000aRamsey-Bordé interferometer\u000aMach\u2013Zehnder interferometer\u000a\u000aAcoustic interferometer\u000aAperture synthesis\u000aAstronomical interferometer\u000aCoherence\u000aInterference\u000aOptical coherence tomography\u000aOptical heterodyne detection\u000aSeismic interferometry\u000aShearing interferometer\u000aVery Long Baseline Interferometry\u000aWave superposition#Interference vs. diffraction\u000aWhite Light Interferometry\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

VThe Birch reduction is an organic reaction which is particularly useful in synthetic organic chemistry. The reaction was reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch (1915\u20131995) working in the Dyson Perrins Laboratory in the University of Oxford, building on earlier work by Wooster and Godfrey in 1937. It converts aromatic compounds having a benzenoid ring into a product, 1,4-cyclohexadienes, in which two hydrogen atoms have been attached on opposite ends of the molecule. It is the organic reduction of aromatic rings in liquid ammonia with sodium, lithium or potassium and an alcohol, such as ethanol and tert-butanol. This reaction is quite unlike catalytic hydrogenation, which usually reduces the aromatic ring all the way to a cyclohexane.\u000aThe original reaction reported by Arthur Birch in 1944 utilized sodium and ethanol. Subsequently A. L. Wilds noted that better yields result with lithium. Also the use of t-butyl alcohol has become common. The reaction is one of the main organic reactions utilized in all types of syntheses.\u000a\u000aAn example is the reduction of naphthalene:\u000a\u000aSeveral reviews have been published.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Basic reaction mechanism ==\u000aA solution of sodium in liquid ammonia consists of the electride salt [Na(NH3)x]+ e\u2212, associated with the intense blue color of these solutions. The solvated electrons add to the aromatic ring to give a radical anion (the arrows depicting the movement of the single electrons should be 'fish-hook' arrows). The added alcohol supplies a proton to the radical anion and also to the penultimate carbanion; for most substrates ammonia is not acidic enough.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Regioselectivity ==\u000aThe reduction of anisole is one of the simplest examples and is shown in equation 1. Still another example is that of benzoic acid illustrated in equation 2.\u000aWhere the radical-anion is protonated initially determines the structure of the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO), alkyl protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. Other investigators have thought the protonation is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents protonation has been thought to come at the site (ipso) of the substituent or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch\u2019s empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product have avoided the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Overall details of the reaction mechanism ==\u000aThe solution of metal in ammonia provides electrons which are taken up by the aromatic ring to form the corresponding radical anion B in the first step of the reaction. This is followed by protonation by the alcohol to form a cyclohexadienyl radical C. Next, a second electron is transferred to the radical to form a cyclohexadienyl carbanion D. In the last step a second proton leads the cyclohexadienyl carbanion to the unconjugated cyclohexadienyl product. These steps are outlined below for the case of anisole.\u000a\u000aThe reaction is known to be third order \u2013 first order in aromatic, first order in the alkali metal, and first order in the alcohol. This requires the rate-limiting step to be the conversion of radical anion B to the cyclohexadienyl radical C.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reaction regioselectivity ==\u000aBirch Reduction has several intricate mechanistic features. These features govern the reaction\u2019s regioselectivity and are considered below. Birch\u2019s rule for aromatics with electron donors such as methoxyl or alkyl is that the product will have the residual double bonds bearing the maximum number of substituents. For aromatics with electron withdrawing groups such as carboxyl, the substituent groups avoid the double bonds. In both cases, with electron donating and with withdrawing groups, the residual double bonds are unconjugated (vide infra). It has been a matter of intense interest to understand reaction mechanisms accounting for this regioselectivity. The essential features are:\u000aIn liquid ammonia alkali metals dissolve to give a blue solution thought of simplistically as having \u201cfree electrons\u201d. The electrons are taken up by the aromatic ring, one at a time. Once the first electron has been absorbed, a radical-anion has been formed. Next the alcohol molecule donates its hydroxylic hydrogen to form a new C-H bond; at this point a radical has been formed. This is followed by the second electron being picked up to give a carbanion of the cyclohexadienyl type (i.e. with C=C-C-C=C in a six-ring and charged minus ). Then this cyclohexadienyl anion is protonated by the alcohol present. The protonation takes place in the middle of the cyclohexadienyl system. This (regio-)selectivity is unique and characteristic.\u000aWhere the radical-anion is protonated initially determines the structure of the product. With an electron donor as methoxy (MeO) or alkyl protonation has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. Other investigators have thought the protonation is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta protonation. With electron withdrawing substituents protonation has been thought to come at the site (ipso) of the substituent or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch\u2019s empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product have avoided the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.\u000aThe reaction mechanism provides the details of molecular change as a reaction proceeds. In the case of donating groups A. J. Birch's preference for meta protonation of the radical anion was based on qualitative reasoning. And it had been noted that no experimental test of this was known.\u000aIn 1961 a simple computation of the electron densities of the radical anion revealed that it was the ortho site which was most negative and thus most likely to protonate. However, A. J. Birch seemed to overlook this result. Additionally, the second proton had been determined by the computations to occur in the center of the cyclohexadienyl anion to give an unconjugated product.\u000aOf historical interest is the uncertainty in the chemical literature at this point. Indeed, there were some further computational results reported. These varied from suggesting a preference for meta radical-anion protonation to suggesting a mixture of ortho and meta protonation.\u000aIn 1990 and 1993 an esoteric test was devised which showed that ortho protonation of the radical anion was preferred over meta (seven to one). This was accompanied by more modern computation which concurred. Both experiment and computations were in agreement with the early 1961 computations.\u000aWith electron withdrawing groups there are literature examples demonstrating the nature of the carbanion just before final protonation. This revealed that the initial radical-anion protonation occurs para to the withdrawing substituent.\u000aThe remaining item for discussion is the final protonation of the cyclohexadienyl anion. In 1961 it was found that simple Hückel computations were unable to distinguish between the different protonation sites. However, when the computations were modified with somewhat more realistic assumptions, the Hückel computations revealed the center carbon to the preferred. The more modern 1990 and 1993 computations were in agreement.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Underlying mechanism of the Birch reduction ==\u000aThe original Birch mechanism suggested that the initial radical anion protonation was meta to the ring methoxy and alkyl groups and the last step, protonation of a cyclohexadienyl anion, was ortho. Birch\u2019s original mechanism was based on qualitative reasoning, namely that the radical anion\u2019s electron density, resulting from the addition of an electron, would become highest meta to an electron donor (such as methoxy or methyl) due to avoiding the usual ortho-para high density in the neutral species.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Hückel computations ==\u000aUsing simple Hückel computations in 1961 it was shown that the Birch mechanism was incorrect. The correct mechanism O is depicted below. The two a-priori alternative mechanisms O and M:\u000a\u000a\u000a== Subsequent literature and varying views ==\u000aHowever, Birch did not accept this conclusion and continued publications suggesting meta protonation of the radical anion. He suggested the meta attack results from \u201copposition of the ortho and para initial charge\u201d.\u000aBothner-By in 1959 had given qualitative arguments favoring meta-protonation as had been suggested previously by Birch.\u000aBurnham in 1969 concluded that protonation is unlikely to occur predominantly at the ortho position and the reaction most probably occurs at the meta position but may occur at both sites at similar rates.\u000aSubsequently, Birch in a review article noted that no experimental method at the time existed which would determine which was correct. But he did note that publication by Burnham favored meta attack.\u000aIn 1980 publications Birch collaborated with Leo Radom and considered ortho and meta densities to be close with a slight ortho preference but with mixtures of ortho and meta protonation occurring. RHF/sto-3g and UHF/sto-3g computations were used to conclude that both ortho and meta substitutions would occur with a slight preference for ortho.\u000aThus there had been a decade of controversy in the literature in which each of these two possible mechanisms was considered to be correct.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Experimental testing and computational verification ==\u000aThen in 1990 and 1993 a method was finally devised to experimentally assess whether the anisole and toluene radical anion protonated ortho or meta. The esoteric method began with the premise that the isotope selectivity in protonation in a protium\u2013deuterium medium would be greater for the radical anion, of the first protonation step, than for the carbanion of the penultimate step. The reasoning was that carbanions are much more basic than the corresponding radical anions and thus will react more exothermically and less selectively in protonation. Experimentally it was determined that less deuterium at the ortho site than meta resulted (1:7) for a variety of methoxylated aromatics. This is a consequence of the greater selectivity of the radical anion protonation. Computations (e.g. ROHF/6-31g) of the electron densities concurred with the experimental observations. Also, it was ascertained that frontier orbital densities did not, and these had been used in some previous reports.\u000aSubsequently, in 1992 and 1996 Birch published twice still suggesting that meta protonation was preferred. This was a reversal of his earlier views as published with Leo Radom.\u000aHowever, textbooks, publishing on the mechanism of the Birch Reduction, have noted that ortho protonation of the initial radical anion is preferred.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Birch reduction with electron withdrawing substituents ==\u000aIn contrast to the examples with electron donating substituents, the case with withdrawing groups is more readily obvious. Thus, as depicted below, the structure of the penultimate dianion D is characterized by its being subject to trapping by alkyl halides.\u000aMechanism of reduction of benzoic acids, including possible alkylation\u000a\u000aThis dianion results independent of whether alcohol is used in the reduction or not. Thus the initial protonation by t-butyl alcohol or ammonia is para rather than ipso as seen in the step from B to C.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Second step of the Birch reduction with regiochemistry giving unconjugated cyclohexadienes ==\u000aThe second step of the Birch reduction affording unconjugated cyclohexadienes also poses mechanistic questions. Thus as shown in the figure below there are three resonance structures B, C and D for the carbanion. Simple Hückel computations lead, as noted in the first entry of the table below, to equal electron densities at the three atoms 1, 3 and 5. However, in contrast to densities the Hückel computation is less naïve about bond orders, and bonds 2\u20133 and 5\u20136 will be shortened as shown in the first entry of the table. With bond orders modifying simple exchange integrals in a Mulliken-Wheland-Mann computation it was shown that electron density at the central atom 1 become largest. More modern RHF computations lead to the same result.\u000aElectron introduction to benzene and 3 resonance structures for the carbanion of the second step, and central protonation to give the unconjugated diene:\u000a\u000aFive carbons of the cyclohexadienyl anion.\u000aThere are known precedents for central anion protonation. Thus conjugated enolates as C=C-C=C-O- have been known for some time as kinetically protonating in the center of the enolate system to afford the \u03b2,\u03b3-unsaturated carbonyl compound under conditions where the anion, and not the enol, is the species protonated.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Birch alkylation ==\u000aIn the presence of an alkyl halide the carbanion can also undergo nucleophilic substitution with carbon-carbon bond formation. In substituted aromatic compounds an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, stabilizes a carbanion and the least-substituted olefin is generated. With an electron-donating substituent the opposite effect is obtained. The reaction produces more of the less thermodynamically stable non-conjugated 1,4-addition product than the more stable conjugated 1,3-diene because the largest orbital coefficient of the HOMO of the conjugated pentadienyl anion intermediate is on the central carbon atom. Once formed, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene is unable to equilibrate to the thermodynamically more stable product; therefore, the observed kinetic product is produced. Experimental alkali metal alternatives that are safer to handle, such as the M-SG reducing agent, also exist.\u000aIn Birch alkylation the anion formed in the Birch reduction is trapped by a suitable electrophile such as a haloalkane, for example:\u000a\u000aIn the reaction depicted below, 1,4-dibromobutane is added to t-butyl benzoate to form an alkylated 1,4-cyclohexadiene product:\u000a\u000a\u000a== Modifications of the Birch reduction ==\u000aSince liquid ammonia has to be condensed into the flask and has to evaporate overnight after the reaction is complete, the whole procedure can be quite troublesome and time-consuming. However, alternative solvents have been employed, such as THF as well as a mixture of n-propylamine and ethylenediamine, both with comparable results. The latter one actually is a modification of the Benkeser Reaction, which in its original forms tends to reduce naphthalene all the way to octahydro- and decahydronaphthalene.\u000a\u000aThis reduction of naphthalene to isotetralin (1,4,5,8-tetrahydronaphthalene) produces some tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) as byproduct, as is the case with the regular Birch reduction.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aBenkeser reaction\u000aSolvated electron\u000aBouveault\u2013Blanc reduction\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==

VLambda calculus (also written as \u03bb-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. First formulated by Alonzo Church to formalize the concept of effective computability, lambda calculus found early successes in the area of computability theory, such as a negative answer to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem. Lambda calculus is a conceptually simple universal model of computation (Turing showed in 1937 that Turing machines equated the lambda calculus in expressiveness). The name derives from the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb) used to denote binding a variable in a function. The letter itself is arbitrary and has no special meaning. Lambda calculus is taught and used in computer science because of its usefulness.\u000aBecause of the importance of the notion of variable binding and substitution, there is not just one system of lambda calculus, and in particular there are typed and untyped variants. Historically, the most important system was the untyped lambda calculus, in which function application has no restrictions (so the notion of the domain of a function is not built into the system). In the Church\u2013Turing Thesis, the untyped lambda calculus is claimed to be capable of computing all effectively calculable functions. The typed lambda calculus is a variety that restricts function application, so that functions can only be applied if they are capable of accepting the given input's "type" of data.\u000aToday, the lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. It is still used in the area of computability theory, although Turing machines are also an important model for computation. Lambda calculus has played an important role in the development of the theory of programming languages. Counterparts to lambda calculus in computer science are functional programming languages, which essentially implement the lambda calculus (augmented with some constants and datatypes). Beyond programming languages, the lambda calculus also has many applications in proof theory. A major example of this is the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence, which gives a correspondence between different systems of typed lambda calculus and systems of formal logic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Lambda calculus in history of mathematics ==\u000aThe lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics. The original system was shown to be logically inconsistent in 1935 when Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser developed the Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox.\u000aSubsequently, in 1936 Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, what is now called the untyped lambda calculus. In 1940, he also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the simply typed lambda calculus.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Informal description ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Motivation ===\u000aComputable functions are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The \u03bb-calculus provides a simple semantics for computation, enabling properties of computation to be studied formally. The \u03bb-calculus incorporates two simplifications that make this semantics simple. The first simplification is that the \u03bb-calculus treats functions "anonymously", without giving them explicit names. For example, the function\u000a\u000acan be rewritten in anonymous form as\u000a\u000a(read as "the pair of  and  is mapped to "). Similarly,\u000a\u000acan be rewritten in anonymous form as , where the input is simply mapped to itself.\u000aThe second simplification is that the \u03bb-calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the  function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns another function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example,\u000a\u000acan be reworked into\u000a\u000aThis method, known as currying, transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.\u000aFunction application of the  function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once\u000a\u000a,\u000awhereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step\u000a\u000ato arrive at the same result.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== The lambda calculus ===\u000aThe lambda calculus consists of a language of lambda terms, which is defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules, which allow manipulation of the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an equational theory or as an operational definition.\u000aAs described above, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions, having no names. They only accept one input variable, with currying used to implement functions with several variables.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Lambda terms ====\u000aThe syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expression and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid C programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a "lambda term".\u000aThe following three rules give an inductive definition that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:\u000aa variable, , is itself a valid lambda term\u000aif  is a lambda term, and  is a variable, then  is a lambda term (called a lambda abstraction);\u000aif  and  are lambda terms, then  is a lambda term (called an application).\u000aNothing else is a lambda term. Thus a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. However, some parentheses can be omitted according to certain rules. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. See #Notation, below.\u000aA lambda abstraction  is a definition of an anonymous function that is capable of taking a single input  and substituting it into the expression . It thus defines an anonymous function that takes x and returns t. For example  is a lambda abstraction for the function  using the term  for . The definition of a function with a lambda abstraction merely "sets up" the function but does not invoke it. The abstraction binds the variable  in the term .\u000aAn application  represents the application of a function  to an input , that is, it represents the act of calling function  on input  to produce .\u000aThere is no concept in lambda calculus of variable declaration. In a definition such as  (i.e. ), the lambda calculus treats  as a variable that is not yet defined. The lambda abstraction  is syntactically valid, and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown .\u000aBracketing may be used and may be needed to disambiguate terms. For example,  and  denote different terms (although coincidentally reduce to the same value.)\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Functions that operate on functions ====\u000aIn lambda calculus, functions are taken to be 'first class values', so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.\u000aFor example,  represents the identity function, , and  represents the identity function applied to . Further,  represents the constant function , the function that always returns , no matter the input. In lambda calculus, function application is regarded as left-associative, so that  means .\u000aThere are several notions of "equivalence" and "reduction" that allow lambda terms to be "reduced" to "equivalent" lambda terms.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Alpha equivalence ====\u000aA basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is alpha equivalence. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in a lambda abstraction, does not (usually) matter. For instance,  and  are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function). The terms  and  are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in a lambda abstraction. In many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.\u000aThe following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define beta reduction.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Free variables ====\u000aThe free variables of a term are those variables not bound by a lambda abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:\u000aThe free variables of  are just \u000aThe set of free variables of  is the set of free variables of , but with  removed\u000aThe set of free variables of  is the union of the set of free variables of  and the set of free variables of .\u000aFor example, the lambda term representing the identity  has no free variables, but the function  has a single free variable, .\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Capture-avoiding substitutions ====\u000aSuppose ,  and  are lambda terms and  and  are variables. The notation  indicates substitution of  for  in  in a capture-avoiding manner. This is defined so that:\u000a;\u000a if ;\u000a;\u000a;\u000a if  and  is not in the free variables of . The variable  is said to be "fresh" for .\u000aFor example, , and .\u000aThe freshness condition (requiring that  is not in the free variables of ) is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions. For example, a substitution is made that ignores the freshness condition: . This substitution turns the constant function  into the identity  by substitution.\u000aIn general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable. For example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in  the lambda abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable , to obtain , and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Beta reduction ====\u000aThe beta reduction rule states that an application of the form  reduces to the term . The notation  is used to indicate that  beta reduces to . For example, for every , . This demonstrates that  really is the identity. Similarly, , which demonstrates that  is a constant function.\u000aThe lambda calculus may be seen as an idealised functional programming language, like Haskell or Standard ML. Under this view, beta reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional beta conversions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate. For instance, consider the term . Here . That is, the term reduces to itself in a single beta reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.\u000aAnother aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data. For instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to truth values, strings, or other non-number objects.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Formal definition ==\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Definition ===\u000aLambda expressions are composed of\u000avariables v1, v2, ..., vn, ...\u000athe abstraction symbols lambda '\u03bb' and dot '.'\u000aparentheses ( )\u000aThe set of lambda expressions, \u039b, can be defined inductively:\u000aIf x is a variable, then x \u2208 \u039b\u000aIf x is a variable and M \u2208 \u039b, then (\u03bbx.M) \u2208 \u039b\u000aIf M, N \u2208 \u039b, then (M N) \u2208 \u039b\u000aInstances of rule 2 are known as abstractions and instances of rule 3 are known as applications.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Notation ===\u000aTo keep the notation of lambda expressions uncluttered, the following conventions are usually applied.\u000aOutermost parentheses are dropped: M N instead of (M N)\u000aApplications are assumed to be left associative: M N P may be written instead of ((M N) P)\u000aThe body of an abstraction extends as far right as possible: \u03bbx.M N means \u03bbx.(M N) and not (\u03bbx.M) N\u000aA sequence of abstractions is contracted: \u03bbx.\u03bby.\u03bbz.N is abbreviated as \u03bbxyz.N\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Free and bound variables ===\u000aThe abstraction operator, \u03bb, is said to bind its variable wherever it occurs in the body of the abstraction. Variables that fall within the scope of an abstraction are said to be bound. All other variables are called free. For example, in the following expression y is a bound variable and x is free: \u03bby.x x y. Also note that a variable is bound by its "nearest" abstraction. In the following example the single occurrence of x in the expression is bound by the second lambda: \u03bbx.y (\u03bbx.z x)\u000aThe set of free variables of a lambda expression, M, is denoted as FV(M) and is defined by recursion on the structure of the terms, as follows:\u000aFV(x) = {x}, where x is a variable\u000aFV(\u03bbx.M) = FV(M) \u005c {x}\u000aFV(M N) = FV(M) \u222a FV(N)\u000aAn expression that contains no free variables is said to be closed. Closed lambda expressions are also known as combinators and are equivalent to terms in combinatory logic.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Reduction ==\u000aThe meaning of lambda expressions is defined by how expressions can be reduced.\u000aThere are three kinds of reduction:\u000a\u03b1-conversion: changing bound variables (alpha);\u000a\u03b2-reduction: applying functions to their arguments (beta);\u000a\u03b7-conversion: which captures a notion of extensionality (eta).\u000aWe also speak of the resulting equivalences: two expressions are \u03b2-equivalent, if they can be \u03b2-converted into the same expression, and \u03b1/\u03b7-equivalence are defined similarly.\u000aThe term redex, short for reducible expression, refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example, (\u03bbx.M) N is a beta-redex in expressing the substitution of N for x in M; if x is not free in M, \u03bbx.M x is an eta-redex. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its reduct; using the previous example, the reducts of these expressions are respectively M[x:=N] and M.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u03b1-conversion ===\u000aAlpha-conversion, sometimes known as alpha-renaming, allows bound variable names to be changed. For example, alpha-conversion of \u03bbx.x might yield \u03bby.y. Terms that differ only by alpha-conversion are called \u03b1-equivalent. Frequently in uses of lambda calculus, \u03b1-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.\u000aThe precise rules for alpha-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when alpha-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an alpha-conversion of \u03bbx.\u03bbx.x could result in \u03bby.\u03bbx.x, but it could not result in \u03bby.\u03bbx.y. The latter has a different meaning from the original.\u000aSecond, alpha-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace x with y in \u03bbx.\u03bby.x, we get \u03bby.\u03bby.y, which is not at all the same.\u000aIn programming languages with static scope, alpha-conversion can be used to make name resolution simpler by ensuring that no variable name masks a name in a containing scope (see alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial).\u000aIn the De Bruijn index notation, any two alpha-equivalent terms are literally identical.\u000a\u000a\u000a==== Substitution ====\u000aSubstitution, written E[V := R], is the process of replacing all free occurrences of the variable V in the expression E with expression R. Substitution on terms of the \u03bb-calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any \u03bb expression).\u000ax[x := N]        \u2261 N\u000ay[x := N]        \u2261 y, if x \u2260 y\u000a(M1 M2)[x := N]  \u2261 (M1[x := N]) (M2[x := N])\u000a(\u03bbx.M)[x := N]   \u2261 \u03bbx.M\u000a(\u03bby.M)[x := N]   \u2261 \u03bby.(M[x := N]), if x \u2260 y, provided y \u2209 FV(N)\u000aTo substitute into a lambda abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to \u03b1-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for (\u03bbx.y)[y := x] to result in (\u03bbx.x), because the substituted x was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is (\u03bbz.x), up to \u03b1-equivalence. Notice that substitution is defined uniquely up to \u03b1-equivalence.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u03b2-reduction ===\u000aBeta-reduction captures the idea of function application. Beta-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the beta-reduction of  ((\u03bbV.E) E\u2032)  is E[V := E\u2032].\u000aFor example, assuming some encoding of 2, 7, ×, we have the following \u03b2-reduction: ((\u03bbn.n×2) 7) \u2192 7×2.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== \u03b7-conversion ===\u000aEta-conversion expresses the idea of extensionality, which in this context is that two functions are the same if and only if they give the same result for all arguments. Eta-conversion converts between \u03bbx.(f x) and f whenever x does not appear free in f.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Normal forms and confluence ==\u000a\u000aFor the untyped lambda calculus, \u03b2-reduction as a rewriting rule is neither strongly normalising nor weakly normalising.\u000aHowever, it can be shown that \u03b2-reduction is confluent. (Of course, we are working up to \u03b1-conversion, i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal, if it is possible to \u03b1-convert one into the other.)\u000aTherefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Encoding datatypes ==\u000a\u000aThe basic lambda calculus may be used to model booleans, arithmetic, data structures and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Arithmetic in lambda calculus ===\u000aThere are several possible ways to define the natural numbers in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the Church numerals, which can be defined as follows:\u000a0 := \u03bbf.\u03bbx.x\u000a1 := \u03bbf.\u03bbx.f x\u000a2 := \u03bbf.\u03bbx.f (f x)\u000a3 := \u03bbf.\u03bbx.f (f (f x))\u000aand so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in Notation:\u000a0 := \u03bbfx.x\u000a1 := \u03bbfx.f x\u000a2 := \u03bbfx.f (f x)\u000a3 := \u03bbfx.f (f (f x))\u000aA Church numeral is a higher-order function\u2014it takes a single-argument function f, and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral n is a function that takes a function f as argument and returns the n-th composition of f, i.e. the function f composed with itself n times. This is denoted f(n) and is in fact the n-th power of f (considered as an operator); f(0) is defined to be the identity function. Such repeated compositions (of a single function f) obey the laws of exponents, which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church's original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of 0 impossible.)\u000aWe can define a successor function, which takes a number n and returns n + 1 by adding another application of f,where '(mf)x' means the function 'f' is applied 'm' times on 'x':\u000aSUCC := \u03bbn.\u03bbf.\u03bbx.f (n f x)\u000aBecause the m-th composition of f composed with the n-th composition of f gives the m+n-th composition of f, addition can be defined as follows:\u000aPLUS := \u03bbm.\u03bbn.\u03bbf.\u03bbx.m f (n f x)\u000aPLUS can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that\u000aPLUS 2 3\u000aand\u000a5\u000aare \u03b2-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding m to a number n can be accomplished by adding 1 m times, an equivalent definition is:\u000aPLUS := \u03bbm.\u03bbn.m SUCC n\u2009\u000aSimilarly, multiplication can be defined as\u000aMULT := \u03bbm.\u03bbn.\u03bbf.m (n f)\u000aAlternatively\u000aMULT := \u03bbm.\u03bbn.m (PLUS n) 0\u000asince multiplying m and n is the same as repeating the add n function m times and then applying it to zero. Exponentiation has a rather simple rendering in Church numerals, namely\u000aPOW := \u03bbb.\u03bbe.e b\u000aThe predecessor function defined by PRED n = n \u2212 1 for a positive integer n and PRED 0 = 0 is considerably more difficult. The formula\u000aPRED := \u03bbn.\u03bbf.\u03bbx.n (\u03bbg.\u03bbh.h (g f)) (\u03bbu.x) (\u03bbu.u)\u000acan be validated by showing inductively that if T denotes (\u03bbg.\u03bbh.h (g f)), then T(n)(\u03bbu.x) = (\u03bbh.h(f(n\u22121)(x))) for n > 0. Two other definitions of PRED are given below, one using conditionals and the other using pairs. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining\u000aSUB := \u03bbm.\u03bbn.n PRED m,\u000aSUB m n yields m \u2212 n when m > n and 0 otherwise.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Logic and predicates ===\u000aBy convention, the following two definitions (known as Church booleans) are used for the boolean values TRUE and FALSE:\u000aTRUE := \u03bbx.\u03bby.x\u000aFALSE := \u03bbx.\u03bby.y\u000a(Note that FALSE is equivalent to the Church numeral zero defined above)\u000a\u000aThen, with these two \u03bb-terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions are equally correct):\u000aAND := \u03bbp.\u03bbq.p q p\u000aOR := \u03bbp.\u03bbq.p p q\u000aNOT := \u03bbp.\u03bba.\u03bbb.p b a\u000aIFTHENELSE := \u03bbp.\u03bba.\u03bbb.p a b\u000aWe are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:\u000aAND TRUE FALSE\u000a\u2261 (\u03bbp.\u03bbq.p q p) TRUE FALSE \u2192\u03b2 TRUE FALSE TRUE\u000a\u2261 (\u03bbx.\u03bby.x) FALSE TRUE \u2192\u03b2 FALSE\u000a\u000aand we see that AND TRUE FALSE is equivalent to FALSE.\u000aA predicate is a function that returns a boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is ISZERO, which returns TRUE if its argument is the Church numeral 0, and FALSE if its argument is any other Church numeral:\u000aISZERO := \u03bbn.n (\u03bbx.FALSE) TRUE\u000aThe following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:\u000aLEQ := \u03bbm.\u03bbn.ISZERO (SUB m n),\u000aand since m = n, if LEQ m n and LEQ n m, it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.\u000aThe availability of predicates and the above definition of TRUE and FALSE make it convenient to write "if-then-else" expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:\u000aPRED := \u03bbn.n (\u03bbg.\u03bbk.ISZERO (g 1) k (PLUS (g k) 1)) (\u03bbv.0) 0\u000awhich can be verified by showing inductively that n (\u03bbg.\u03bbk.ISZERO (g 1) k (PLUS (g k) 1)) (\u03bbv.0) is the add n \u2212 1 function for n > 0.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Pairs ===\u000aA pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of TRUE and FALSE, by using the Church encoding for pairs. For example, PAIR encapsulates the pair (x,y), FIRST returns the first element of the pair, and SECOND returns the second.\u000aPAIR := \u03bbx.\u03bby.\u03bbf.f x y\u000aFIRST := \u03bbp.p TRUE\u000aSECOND := \u03bbp.p FALSE\u000aNIL := \u03bbx.TRUE\u000aNULL := \u03bbp.p (\u03bbx.\u03bby.FALSE)\u000aA linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the PAIR of an element and a smaller list. The predicate NULL tests for the value NIL. (Alternatively, with NIL := FALSE, the construct l (\u03bbh.\u03bbt.\u03bbz.deal_with_head_h_and_tail_t) (deal_with_nil) obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).\u000aAs an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps (m, n) to (n, n + 1) can be defined as\u000a\u03a6 := \u03bbx.PAIR (SECOND x) (SUCC (SECOND x))\u000awhich allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:\u000aPRED := \u03bbn.FIRST (n \u03a6 (PAIR 0 0)).\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Recursion and fixed points ===\u000a\u000aRecursion is the definition of a function using the function itself; on the face of it, lambda calculus does not allow this (we can't refer to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value, as all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus). However, this impression is misleading: in\u2002 (\u03bbx.x x) y \u2002both x\u200d\u2009\u200d's refer to the same lambda term, y, so it is possible for a lambda expression \u2013 here y \u2013 to be arranged to receive itself as its argument value, through self-application.\u000aConsider for instance the factorial function F(n) recursively defined by\u000aF(n) = 1, if n = 0; else n × F(n \u2212 1).\u000aIn the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a parameter (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it \u2013 applying it to an argument \u2013 will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called r here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point:\u000aG := \u03bbr. \u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × (r r (n\u22121)))\u000a\u000awith\u2002 r r x = F x = G r x \u2002to hold, so\u2002 r = G \u2002and\u000a\u000aF := G G = (\u03bbx.x x) G\u000aThe self-application achieves replication here, passing the function's lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.\u000aThis solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes:\u000aG := \u03bbr. \u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × (r (n\u22121)))\u000a\u000awith\u2002 r x = F x = G r x \u2002to hold, so\u2002 r = G r =: FIX G \u2002and\u000a\u000aF := FIX G \u2002where\u2002 FIX g := (r where r = g r) = g (FIX g)\u000a\u000aso that\u2002 FIX G = G (FIX G) = (\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × ((FIX G) (n\u22121))))\u000a\u000aGiven a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. G here), the fixed-point combinator FIX will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, F). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression (FIX G) is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving self-reference.\u000aIn fact, there are many possible definitions for this FIX operator, the simplest of them being:\u000aY := \u03bbg.(\u03bbx.g (x x)) (\u03bbx.g (x x))\u000aIn the lambda calculus, Y g\u2009 is a fixed-point of g, as it expands to:\u000aY g\u000a\u03bbh.((\u03bbx.h (x x)) (\u03bbx.h (x x))) g\u000a(\u03bbx.g (x x)) (\u03bbx.g (x x))\u000ag ((\u03bbx.g (x x)) (\u03bbx.g (x x)))\u000ag (Y g)\u000aNow, to perform our recursive call to the factorial function, we would simply call (Y G) n,  where n is the number we are calculating the factorial of. Given n = 4, for example, this gives:\u000a(Y G) 4\u000aG (Y G) 4\u000a(\u03bbr.\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × (r (n\u22121)))) (Y G) 4\u000a(\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × ((Y G) (n\u22121)))) 4\u000a1, if 4 = 0; else 4 × ((Y G) (4\u22121))\u000a4 × (G (Y G) (4\u22121))\u000a4 × ((\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × ((Y G) (n\u22121)))) (4\u22121))\u000a4 × (1, if 3 = 0; else 3 × ((Y G) (3\u22121)))\u000a4 × (3 × (G (Y G) (3\u22121)))\u000a4 × (3 × ((\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × ((Y G) (n\u22121)))) (3\u22121)))\u000a4 × (3 × (1, if 2 = 0; else 2 × ((Y G) (2\u22121))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × (G (Y G) (2\u22121))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × ((\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × ((Y G) (n\u22121)))) (2\u22121))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × (1, if 1 = 0; else 1 × ((Y G) (1\u22121)))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (G (Y G) (1\u22121)))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × ((\u03bbn.(1, if n = 0; else n × ((Y G) (n\u22121)))) (1\u22121)))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (1, if 0 = 0; else 0 × ((Y G) (0\u22121))))))\u000a4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × (1))))\u000a24\u000aEvery recursively defined function can be seen as a fixed point of some suitably defined function closing over the recursive call with an extra argument, and therefore, using Y, every recursively defined function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Standard terms ===\u000aCertain terms have commonly accepted names:\u000a I := \u03bbx.x\u000a K := \u03bbx.\u03bby.x\u000a S := \u03bbx.\u03bby.\u03bbz.x z (y z)\u000a B := \u03bbx.\u03bby.\u03bbz.x (y z)\u000a C := \u03bbx.\u03bby.\u03bbz.x z y\u000a W := \u03bbx.\u03bby.x y y\u000a U := \u03bbx.x x\u000a \u03c9 := \u03bbx.x x\u000a \u03a9 := \u03c9 \u03c9\u000a Y := \u03bbg.(\u03bbx.g (x x)) (\u03bbx.g (x x))\u000a\u000a\u000a== Typed lambda calculus ==\u000a\u000aA typed lambda calculus is a typed formalism that uses the lambda-symbol () to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the untyped lambda calculus but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and untyped lambda calculus a special case with only one type.\u000aTyped lambda calculi are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.\u000aTyped lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism and they can be considered as the internal language of classes of categories, e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of Cartesian closed categories (CCCs).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Computable functions and lambda calculus ==\u000aA function F: N \u2192 N of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression f such that for every pair of x, y in N, F(x)=y if and only if f x =\u03b2 y,  where x and y are the Church numerals corresponding to x and y, respectively and =\u03b2 meaning equivalence with beta reduction. This is one of the many ways to define computability; see the Church-Turing thesis for a discussion of other approaches and their equivalence.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Undecidability of equivalence ==\u000aThere is no algorithm that takes as input two lambda expressions and outputs TRUE or FALSE depending on whether or not the two expressions are equivalent. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As is common for a proof of undecidability, the proof shows that no computable function can decide the equivalence. Church's thesis is then invoked to show that no algorithm can do so.\u000aChurch's proof first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a normal form. A normal form is an equivalent expression that cannot be reduced any further under the rules imposed by the form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a Gödel numbering for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression e that closely follows the proof of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. If e is applied to its own Gödel number, a contradiction results.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Lambda calculus and programming languages ==\u000aAs pointed out by Peter Landin's 1965 paper A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation, sequential procedural programming languages can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.\u000aLambda calculus reifies "functions" and makes them first-class objects, which raises implementation complexity when it is implemented.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Anonymous functions ===\u000a\u000aFor example in Lisp the 'square' function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:\u000a\u000aThe above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol lambda creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names, (x) \u2014 just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, (* x x). The Haskell example is identical. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.\u000aFor example Pascal and many other imperative languages have long supported passing subprograms as arguments to other subprograms through the mechanism of function pointers. However, function pointers are not a sufficient condition for functions to be first class datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at run-time. And this run-time creation of functions is supported in Smalltalk, Javascript, and more recently in Scala, Eiffel ("agents"), C# ("delegates") and C++11, among others.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Reduction strategies ===\u000a\u000aWhether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. The distinction between reduction strategies relates to the distinction in functional programming languages between eager evaluation and lazy evaluation.\u000aFull beta reductions\u000aAny redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy\u2014with regard to reducibility, "all bets are off".\u000aApplicative order\u000aThe leftmost, innermost redex is always reduced first. Intuitively this means a function's arguments are always reduced before the function itself. Applicative order always attempts to apply functions to normal forms, even when this is not possible.\u000aMost programming languages (including Lisp, ML and imperative languages like C and Java) are described as "strict", meaning that functions applied to non-normalising arguments are non-normalising. This is done essentially using applicative order, call by value reduction (see below), but usually called "eager evaluation".\u000aNormal order\u000aThe leftmost, outermost redex is always reduced first. That is, whenever possible the arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced.\u000aCall by name\u000aAs normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example \u03bbx.(\u03bbx.x)x is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex (\u03bbx.x)x.\u000aCall by value\u000aOnly the outermost redexes are reduced: a redex is reduced only when its right hand side has reduced to a value (variable or lambda abstraction).\u000aCall by need\u000aAs normal order, but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument, which is then reduced only "when it is needed". Called in practical contexts "lazy evaluation". In implementations this "name" takes the form of a pointer, with the redex represented by a thunk.\u000aApplicative order is not a normalising strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define \u03a9 = \u03c9\u03c9 where \u03c9 = \u03bbx.xx. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again \u03a9. Since this is the only available reduction, \u03a9 has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression KI\u03a9 = (\u03bbx.\u03bby.x) (\u03bbx.x)\u03a9 is reduced by first reducing \u03a9 to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since \u03a9 has no normal form, applicative order fails to find a normal form for KI\u03a9.\u000aIn contrast, normal order is so called because it always finds a normalising reduction, if one exists. In the above example, KI\u03a9 reduces under normal order to I, a normal form. A drawback is that redexes in the arguments may be copied, resulting in duplicated computation (for example, (\u03bbx.xx) ((\u03bbx.x)y) reduces to ((\u03bbx.x)y) ((\u03bbx.x)y) using this strategy; now there are two redexes, so full evaluation needs two more steps, but if the argument had been reduced first, there would now be none).\u000aThe positive tradeoff of using applicative order is that it does not cause unnecessary computation, if all arguments are used, because it never substitutes arguments containing redexes and hence never needs to copy them (which would duplicate work). In the above example, in applicative order (\u03bbx.xx) ((\u03bbx.x)y) reduces first to (\u03bbx.xx)y and then to the normal order yy, taking two steps instead of three.\u000aMost purely functional programming languages (notably Miranda and its descendents, including Haskell), and the proof languages of theorem provers, use lazy evaluation, which is essentially the same as call by need. This is like normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using sharing. In the example given above, (\u03bbx.xx) ((\u03bbx.x)y) reduces to ((\u03bbx.x)y) ((\u03bbx.x)y), which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== A note about complexity ===\u000aWhile the idea of beta reduction seems simple enough, it is not an atomic step, in that it must have a non-trivial cost when estimating computational complexity. To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable V in the expression E, implying a time cost, or one must keep track of these locations in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of V in E is O(n) in the length n of E. This has led to the study of systems that use explicit substitution. Sinot's director strings offer a way of tracking the locations of free variables in expressions.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Parallelism and concurrency ===\u000aThe Church\u2013Rosser property of the lambda calculus means that evaluation (\u03b2-reduction) can be carried out in any order, even in parallel. This means that various nondeterministic evaluation strategies are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for parallelism. One can add constructs such as Futures to the lambda calculus. Other process calculi have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Semantics ==\u000aThe fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set D isomorphic to the function space D \u2192 D, of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such D can exist, by cardinality constraints because the set of all functions from D to D has greater cardinality than D, unless D is a singleton set.\u000aIn the 1970s, Dana Scott showed that, if only continuous functions were considered, a set or domain D with the required property could be found, thus providing a model for the lambda calculus.\u000aThis work also formed the basis for the denotational semantics of programming languages.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Further reading ==\u000aAbelson, Harold & Gerald Jay Sussman.

VElegy Written in a Country Churchyard is a poem by Thomas Gray, completed in 1750 and first published in 1751. The poem\u2019s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray\u2019s thoughts following the death of the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.\u000aThe poem is an elegy in name but not in form; it employs a style similar to that of contemporary odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.\u000aThe poem quickly became popular. It was printed many times, translated into many languages, and praised by critics even after Gray's other poetry had fallen out of favour. Later critics tended to praise its language and universal aspects, but some felt the ending was unconvincing, failing to resolve the questions the poem raised; or that the poem did not do enough to present a political statement that would serve to help the obscure rustic poor who form its central image.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Background ==\u000a\u000aGray's life was surrounded by loss and death, and many people that he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded a few days later by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh in the minds of the Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life. With spring nearing, Gray questioned if his own life would enter into a sort of rebirth cycle or, should he die, if there would be anyone to remember him. Gray's meditations during spring 1750 turned to how individuals' reputations would survive. Eventually, Gray remembered some lines of poetry that he composed in 1742 following the death of West, a poet he knew. Using that previous material, he began to compose a poem that would serve as an answer to the various questions he was pondering.\u000aOn 3 June 1750, Gray moved to Stoke Poges, and on 12 June he completed Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard. Immediately, he included the poem in a letter he sent to Walpole, that said:\u000a\u000aAs I live in a place where even the ordinary tattle of the town arrives not till it is stale, and which produces no events of its own, you will not desire any excuse from me for writing so seldom, especially as of all people living I know you are the least a friend to letters spun out of one's own brains, with all the toil and constraint that accompanies sentimental productions. I have been here at Stoke a few days (where I shall continue good part of the summer); and having put an end to a thing, whose beginnings you have seen long ago. I immediately send it you. You will, I hope, look upon it in light of a thing with an end to it; a merit that most of my writing have wanted, and are like to want, but which this epistle I am determined shall not want.\u000a\u000aThe letter reveals that Gray felt that the poem was unimportant, and that he did not expect it to become as popular or influential as it did. Gray dismisses its positives as merely being that he was able to complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus.\u000aThe version that was later published and reprinted was a 32-stanza version with the "Epitaph" conclusion. Before the final version was published, it was circulated in London society by Walpole, who ensured that it would be a popular topic of discussion throughout 1750. By February 1751, Gray received word that William Owen, the publisher of the Magazine of Magazines, would print the poem on 16 February; the copyright laws of the time did not require Gray's approval for publication. With Walpole's help, he was able to convince Robert Dodsley to print the poem on 15 February as a quarto pamphlet.\u000aWalpole added a preface to the poem reading: "The following POEM came into my hands by Accident, if the general Approbation with which this little Piece has been spread, may be call'd by so slight a Term as Accident. It is the Approbation which makes it unnecessary for me to make any Apology but to the Author: As he cannot but feel some Satisfaction in having pleas'd so many Readers already, I flatter myself he will forgive my communicating that Pleasure to many more."\u000aThe pamphlet contained woodblock illustrations and was printed without attribution to Gray, at his request. Immediately after, Owen's magazine with Gray's poem was printed but contained multiple errors and other problems. In a 20 February letter to Walpole, Gray thanked him for intervening and helping to get a quality version of the poem published before Owen. It was so popular that it was reprinted twelve times and reproduced in many different periodicals until 1765, including in Gray's Six Poems (1753), in his Odes (1757), and in Volume IV of Dodsley's 1755 compilation of poetry. The revised version of 1768 was that later printed. There were many translations of the poem, including Latin versions by Christopher Anstey and Robert Lloyd in 1762. Other translations include into Italian by Melchiorre Cesarotti (1772), Giuseppe Torelli (1776), and Giacomo Zanella (1869), into Russian by Vasily Zhukovsky (1802 and 1839), into Welsh by Thomas Jones of Denbigh (1831), and into Greek by George Denman (1871). The poem was translated into Spanish by 1823 and Japanese by 1882.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Composition ==\u000a\u000aThe poem most likely originated in the poetry that Gray composed in 1742. William Mason, in Memoirs, discussed his friend Gray and the origins of Elegy: "I am inclined to believe that the Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time [August 1742] also: Though I am aware that as it stands at present, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally I shall show in my notes on the poem." Mason's argument was a guess, but he argued that one of Gray's poems from the Eton Manuscript, a copy of Gray's handwritten poems owned by Eton College, was a 22-stanza rough draft of the Elegy called "Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard". The manuscript copy contained many ideas which were reworked and revised as he attempted to work out the ideas that would later form the Elegy. A later copy was entered into Gray's commonplace book and a third version, included in an 18 December 1750 letter, was sent to Thomas Wharton. The draft sent to Walpole was subsequently lost.\u000aThere are two possible ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, argues that the Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a balance that set up the debate, and was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. The early version of the poem was finished, according to Mason, in August 1742, but there is little evidence to give such a definite date. Mason argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there is little to indicate that Mason would have such information.\u000aInstead, Walpole wrote to Mason to say: "The Churchyard was, I am persuaded, posterior to West's death at least three or four years, as you will see by my note. At least I am sure that I had the twelve or more first lines from himself above three years after that period, and it was long before he finished it."\u000aThe two did not resolve their disagreement, but Walpole did concede the matter, possibly to keep the letters between them polite. But Gray's outline of the events provides the second possible way the poem was composed: the first lines of the poem were written some time in 1746 and he probably wrote more of the poem during the time than Walpole claimed. The letters show the likelihood of Walpole's date for the composition, as a 12 June 1750 letter from Gray to Walpole stated that Walpole was provided lines from the poem years before and the two were not on speaking terms until after 1745. The only other letter to discuss the poem was one sent to Wharton on 11 September 1746, which alludes to the poem being worked on.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Genre ==\u000aThe poem is not a conventional part of Theocritus's elegiac tradition, because it does not mourn an individual. The use of "elegy" is related to the poem relying on the concept of lacrimae rerum, or despair regarding the human condition. The poem lacks many standard features of the elegy: an invocation, mourners, flowers, and shepherds. The theme does not emphasise loss as do other elegies, and its natural setting is not a primary component of its theme. It can be included in the tradition as a memorial poem, although not necessarily for one person, and the poem contains thematic elements of the elegiac genre, especially mourning. The model for Gray's choice of genre and style is likely Milton's Lycidas but it lacks many of the ornamental aspects found in Milton's poem. Gray's poem is natural, whereas Milton's is more artificially designed.\u000aIn evoking the English countryside, the poem is connected to the picturesque tradition found in John Dyer's Grongar Hill (1726), and later in James Beattie's The Minstrel (1771) and William Crowe's Lewesdon Hill (1788). "However, it diverges from this tradition in focusing on the death of a poet. Much of the poem deals with questions that were linked to Gray's own life; during the poem's composition, he was confronted with the death of others and questioned his own mortality. Although universal in its statements on life and death, the poem was grounded in Gray's feelings about his own life, and served as an epitaph for himself. As such, it falls within an old poetic tradition of poets contemplating their legacy. The poem, as an elegy, also serves to lament the death of others, including West. This is not to say that Gray's poem was like others of the graveyard school of poetry; instead, Gray tries to avoid a description that would evoke the horror common to other poems in the elegiac tradition. This is compounded further by the narrator trying to avoid an emotional response to death, by relying on rhetorical questions and discussing what his surroundings lack.\u000aThe poem is connected to the ode tradition found within Gray's other works and in those of Joseph Warton and William Collins and to a lesser extent in English ballads. The poem, as it developed from its original form, incorporated various traditional poetic techniques and partly relied on the poetic metre of those like Petrarch. Between the first and final versions, the poem becomes more like Milton and less like Horace in its form. The poem actively relied on "English" techniques and language. The stanza form, quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, was common to English poetry and used throughout the 16th century. Any foreign diction that Gray relied on was merged with English words and phrases to give them an "English" feel. Many of the foreign words Gray adapted were previously used by Shakespeare or Milton, securing an "English" tone, and he emphasised monosyllabic words throughout his elegy to add a rustic English tone.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Poem ==\u000aThe poem begins in a churchyard with a narrator who is describing his surroundings in vivid detail. The narrator emphasises both aural and visual sensations as he examines the area in relation to himself:\u000aThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\u000aThe lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea\u000aThe ploughman homeward plods his weary way,\u000aAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\u000aNow fades the glimm'ring landscape on the sight,\u000aAnd all the air a solemn stillness holds,\u000aSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\u000aAnd drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;\u000aSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r\u000aThe moping owl does to the moon complain\u000aOf such, as wand'ring near her secret bow'r,\u000aMolest her ancient solitary reign. (lines 1\u201312)\u000aAs the poem continues, the narrator begins to focus less on the countryside and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions begin to move from sensations to his own thoughts about the dead. As the poem changes, the narrator begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the narrator's thoughts on waste that comes in nature:\u000aFull many a gem of purest ray serene,\u000aThe dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:\u000aFull many a flow'r is born to blush unseen,\u000aAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\u000aSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast\u000aThe little tyrant of his fields withstood;\u000aSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,\u000aSome Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.\u000aThe applause of listening senates to command,\u000aThe threats of pain and ruin to despise,\u000aTo scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,\u000aAnd read their hist'ry in a nation's eyes,\u000aTheir lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd alone\u000aTheir growing virtues, but their crimes confin'd;\u000aForbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,\u000aAnd shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\u000aThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\u000aTo quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\u000aOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride\u000aWith incense kindled at the Muse's flame. (lines 53\u201372)\u000aThe narrator focuses on the inequities that come from death, obscuring individuals, while he begins to resign himself to his own inevitable fate. As the poem ends, the narrator begins to deal with death in a direct manner as he discusses how humans desire to be remembered. As the narrator does so, the poem shifts and the first narrator is replaced by a second who describes the death of the first:\u000aFor thee, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead\u000aDost in these lines their artless tale relate;\u000aIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\u000aSome kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,\u000aHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\u000aOft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\u000aBrushing with hasty steps the dews away\u000aTo meet the sun upon the upland lawn. (lines 93\u2013100)\u000aThe poem concludes with a description of the poet's grave, over which the narrator is meditating, together with a description of the end of the poet's life:\u000aThere at the foot of yonder nodding beech\u000aThat wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,\u000aHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\u000aAnd pore upon the brook that babbles by.\u000aHard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\u000aMutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,\u000aNow drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,\u000aOr craz'd with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.\u000aOne morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,\u000aAlong the heath and near his fav'rite tree;\u000aAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\u000aNor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;\u000aThe next with dirges due in sad array\u000aSlow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.\u000aApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,\u000aGrav'd on the stone beneath yon aged thorn." (lines 101\u2013116)\u000aAn epitaph is included after the conclusion of the poem. The epitaph reveals that the poet whose grave is the focus of the poem was unknown and obscure. The poet was separated from the other common people because he was unable to join with the common affairs of life, and circumstance kept him from becoming something greater:\u000aHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth\u000aA youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.\u000aFair Science frown'd not on his humble birth,\u000aAnd Melancholy mark'd him for her own.\u000aLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere,\u000aHeav'n did a recompense as largely send:\u000aHe gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,\u000aHe gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.\u000aNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\u000aOr draw his frailties from their dread abode,\u000a(There they alike in trembling hope repose)\u000aThe bosom of his Father and his God. (lines 117\u2013128)\u000aThe original conclusion from the earlier version of the poem promotes the view that humans should be resigned to the fact that we will die, which differs from the indirect, third person description in the final version:\u000aThe thoughtless World to majesty may bow\u000aExalt the brave, & idolize Success\u000aBut more to Innocence their Safety owe\u000aThan Power & Genius e'er conspired to bless\u000aAnd thou, who mindful of the unhonour'd Dead\u000aDost in these Notes thy artless Tale relate\u000aBy Night & lonely contemplation led\u000aTo linger in the gloomy Walks of Fate\u000aHark how the sacred Calm, that broods around\u000aBids ev'ry fierce tumultous Passion ease\u000aIn still small Accents whisp'ring from the Ground\u000aA grateful Earnest of eternal Peace\u000aNo more with Reason & thyself at strife;\u000aGive anxious Cares & endless Wishes room\u000aBut thro' the cool sequester'd Vale of Life\u000aPursue the silent Tenour of thy Doom.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Themes ==\u000a\u000aThe poem is connected to many British poems that contemplate death and sought to make it more familiar and tame. The elegy contemplates the death of the poet and is similar to other works within the British tradition, including Jonathan Swift's Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift, a satirical version of a eulogy. When compared to other works by Graveyard poets, such as Blair's The Grave (1743), the poem has less emphasis on common images. His description of the moon, birds, and trees lacks the horror found in the other poems and Gray avoids mentioning the word "grave", instead using other words as euphemisms.\u000aThere is a difference in tone between the two versions of the elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.\u000aThe first version of the elegy is among the few early poems composed by Gray in English, including "Sonnet on the Death of Richard West," his "Eton Ode", and his "Ode to Adversity". All four contain Gray's meditations on mortality that were inspired by West's death. The later version of the poem kept the stoic resignation regarding death, as the narrator still accepts death. The poem concludes with an epitaph, which reinforces Gray's indirect and reticent manner of writing. Although the ending reveals the narrator's repression of feelings surrounding his inevitable fate, it is optimistic. The epitaph describes faith in a "trembling hope" that he cannot know while alive.\u000aIn describing the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's philosophy of the sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described in the beginning of the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.\u000aOn the difference between the obscure and the renowned in the poem, scholar David Cecil argued, "Death, he perceives, dwarfs human differences. There is not much to choose between the great and the humble, once they are in the grave. It may be that there never was; it may be that in the obscure graveyard lie those who but for circumstance would have been as famous as Milton and Hampden." However, death is not completely democratic because "if circumstances prevented them from achieving great fame, circumstances also saved them from committing great crimes. Yet there is a special pathos in these obscure tombs; the crude inscriptions on the clumsy monuments are so poignant a reminder of the vain longing of all men, however humble, to be loved and to be remembered."\u000aThe poem ends with the narrator turning towards his own fate, accepting his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is mysterious and tragic. Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.\u000aMany scholars, including Lonsdale, believe that the poem's message is too universal to require a specific event or place for inspiration, but Gray's letters suggest that there were historical influences in its composition. In particular, it is possible that Gray was interested in debates over the treatment of the poor, and that he supported the political structure of his day, which was to support the poor who worked but look down on those that refused to. However, Gray's message is incomplete, because he ignored the poor's past rebellions and struggles. The poem ignores politics to focus on various comparisons between a rural and urban life in a psychological manner. The argument between living a rural life or urban life lets Gray discuss questions that answer how he should live his own life, but the conclusion of the poem does not resolve the debate as the narrator is able to recreate himself in a manner that reconciles both types of life while arguing that poetry is capable of preserving those who have died. It is probable that Gray wanted to promote the hard work of the poor but to do nothing to change their social position. Instead of making claims of economic injustice, Gray accommodates differing political views. This is furthered by the ambiguity in many of the poem's lines, including the statement "Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood" that could be read either as Oliver Cromwell being guiltless for violence during the English Civil War or merely as villagers being compared to the guilty Cromwell. The poem's primary message is to promote the idea of "Englishness", and the pastoral English countryside. The earlier version lacks many of the later version's English aspects, especially as Gray replaced many classical figures with English ones: Cato the Younger by Hampden, Tully by Milton, and Julius Caesar by Cromwell.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Influence ==\u000aIn choosing an "English" feel to the language and setting, Gray provided a model for later poets wishing to describe England and the English countryside. His choice of language, words, and feelings that connected to rural England served as the model for Oliver Goldsmith's and William Cowper's works during the second half of the 18th century. Beyond his own poetry, Goldsmith would play around with the lines of the poem by removing words to alter its meaning. Gray's Elegy was highly influential and provoked a response from the Romantic poets. When William Wordsworth wrote the preface to Lyrical Ballads he responded to Gray's techniques and to the Elegy with his "Intimations of Immortality" ode. As a whole, the Romantics believed that Gray represented the poetic orthodoxy they were rebelling against in that he did not try to overcome death in his poem, but they used Gray's ideas when attempting to define their own beliefs. Gray also influenced how Wordsworth described his education and the death of his father in The Prelude. As a schoolboy, Percy Bysshe Shelley translated part of the Elegy into Latin and visited the churchyard at Stoke Poges. Later, in 1815, when Shelley stayed in Lechlade, he again visited the churchyard, and composed "A Summer Evening Churchyard, Lechlade, Gloucestershire", which echoes the language of Gray.\u000aGray's influence lasted throughout the Victorian and Modern periods. Alfred, Lord Tennyson, subsequently adopted many features of the Elegy in his poem In Memoriam. He established a ceremonial, almost religious, tone by reusing the idea of the "knell" and "toll" to mark the coming night. This is followed with the poet narrator looking through letters of his deceased friend, echoing Gray's narrator reading the tombstones to connect to the deceased. Robert Browning relied on a similar setting to the Elegy in his pastoral poem "Love Among the Ruins", which describes the desire for glory and how everything ends in death. Unlike Gray, Browning adds a female figure and argues that nothing but love matters. Thomas Hardy memorised Gray's Elegy, he named his fourth novel, Far from the Madding Crowd, after a line of the poem, and it influenced his collection Wessex Poems and Other Verses (1898). Many of Hardy's poems contained a graveyard theme, and he based his poems on Gray's views. In particular, his 1898 "Friends Beyond" was modelled on the Elegy. Even the frontispiece to the collection contained an image of a graveyard with a reference to the first line of the elegy.\u000aIt is possible that parts of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets are derived from Gray's elegy, although Eliot believed that Gray's diction, along with 18th-century poetic diction in general, was restrictive and limited. The Four Quartets covers many of the same views, and Eliot's village is similar to Gray's hamlet. There are many echoes of Gray's language throughout the Four Quartets; both poems rely on the yew tree as an image and use the word "twittering", which was uncommon at the time. Each of Eliot's four poems have parallels to Gray's poem, but "Little Gidding" is deeply indebted to the elegy's meditation on a "neglected spot". Of the similarities between the poems, it is Eliot's reuse of Gray's image of "stillness" that forms the strongest parallel, an image that is essential to the poem's arguments on mortality and society.\u000aHumphrey Cobb's 1935 anti-war novel Paths of Glory took its name from line 36 of the poem:\u000aThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\u000aAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,\u000aAwaits alike the inevitable hour.\u000aThe paths of glory lead but to the grave. (lines 33\u201336)\u000aCobb's original draft had no title; the name was picked as a result of a competition held by the publisher. Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick read a copy of the novel whilst at college, and later went on to direct a film version, which was released in 1957.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Critical response ==\u000a\u000aThe immediate response to the final draft version of the poem was positive, and Walpole was very pleased with the work. During the summer of 1750, Gray received so much positive support regarding the poem that he was in dismay, but did not mention it in his letters until an 18 December 1750 letter to Wharton. In the letter, Gray said,\u000a\u000aThe Stanza's, which I now enclose to you have had the Misfortune by Mr W:s Fault to be made ... publick, for which they certainly were never meant, but it is too late to complain. They have been so applauded, it is quite a Shame to repeat it. I mean not to be modest; but I mean, it is a shame for those who have said such superlative Things about them, that I can't repeat them. I should have been glad, that you & two or three more People had liked them, which would have satisfied my ambition on this head amply.\u000a\u000aThe poem was praised for its universal aspects, and Gray became one of the most famous English poets of his era. Despite his popularity, after his death only his elegy remained popular until 20th-century critics began to re-evaluate his poetry. The 18th-century writer James Beattie was said by Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet to have written a letter to him claiming, "Of all the English poets of this age, Mr. Gray is most admired, and I think with justice; yet there are comparatively speaking but a few who know of anything of his, but his 'Church-yard Elegy,' which is by no means the best of his works."\u000aThe poem remained popular, and, in Canadian history, it is claimed that the British General James Wolfe read the poem before his British troops arrived at the Plains of Abraham in September 1759 as part of the Seven Years' War. After reading the poem, he is reported to have said: "Gentlemen, I would rather have written those lines than take Quebec tomorrow." Adam Smith, in his 21st lecture on rhetoric in 1763, argued that poetry should deal with "A temper of mind that differs very little from the common tranquillity of mind is what we can best enter into, by the perusal of a small piece of a small length ... an Ode or Elegy in which there is no odds but in the measure which differ little from the common state of mind are what most please us. Such is that on the Church yard, or Eton College by Mr Grey. The Best of Horaces (tho inferior to Mr Greys) are all of this sort." Even Samuel Johnson, who knew Gray but did not like his poetry, later praised the poem when he wrote in his Life of Gray (1779) that it "abounds with images which find a mirror in every breast; and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo. The four stanzas beginning Yet even these bones, are to me original: I have never seen the notions in any other place; yet he that reads them here, persuades himself that he has always felt them." Many reviews of Johnson's Lives of the Poets thought that Johnson was too harsh towards Gray, but a 1781 review in the Critical Review declared, "On his Elegy in a Country Church-Yard, we agree with Dr. Johnson, that too much praise cannot well be lavished". Attacks continued until a 1782 review of the work in the Annual Register, which proclaimed, "That the doctor was not over zealous to allow him the degree of praise that the public voice had universally assigned him, is, we think, sufficiently apparent. Partiality to his beautiful elegy, had perhaps allotted him a rank above his general merits."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Later response ===\u000aJohnson's critical analysis of the poem prompted many others to write their own critiques debating the poem's merits. In 1783, John Young wrote an expansion to Johnson\u2019s Life of Gray and claimed, "The Elegy written in a Country Church Yard has become a staple in English poetry. It is even beginning to get into years." After analysing each aspect of the poem, Young concluded by describing how the anthropomorphised "Criticism" would respond to the poem: "In examining the Elegy written in a Country Church-yard, she has found much room for censure, and some room for praise. The Piece has been much over-rated; and many serious persons, who mediate on death from a sense of duty, consider Conscience as concerned in their finding this Meditation perfect. Of perfections no doubt it contains some; but it contains blemishes too; and if Criticism grant it nothing but its merit, what then will be its praise?" Beyond John Young, other writers produced criticisms of "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard" in response to Johnson's critique. Robert Potter's 1783 is a general defence of Gray, John Scott's Critical Essays (1785) praised the poem along with a close analysis of the text, and Wakefield's 1785 edition of Gray's poems refuted various statements made by Johnson in the notes to the text. In 1785, Gilbert Wakefield produced a 207 page edition of the elegy with Gray's other poems with copious footnotes and notes to criticism provided in scholarship since the poem's publication. Following in 1791 was James Boswell's Life of Johnson, which provided more statements by Johnson on Gray: "Sir, I do not think Mr. Gray a superior sort of poet. He has not a bold imagination, nor much command of words. The obscurity in which he has involved himself will not make us think him sublime. His Elegy in a Churchyard has a happy selection of images, but I don't like his great things." Boswell adds that his own view of Gray was far more positive to respond to both critics of Johnson's view and to Johnson's writing.\u000aDebate over the poem's merits continued into the 19th century, and Victorian critics were unconvinced by the poem's merits. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth, in his "Preface" to Lyrical Ballads attacked Gray's use of poetic diction but also relied heavily on Gray's techniques and ideas. The later Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was an admirer of the poem and influenced by it, as was Thomas Hardy, who knew the poem by heart. At the end of the century, Matthew Arnold, in his 1881 collection of critical writings, said, "The Elegy pleased; it could not but please: but Gray's poetry, on the whole, astonished his contemporaries at first more than it pleased them; it was so unfamiliar, so unlike the sort of poetry in vogue." In 1882, Edmund Gosse analyzed the reception of Gray's poem: "It is curious to reflect upon the modest and careless mode in which that poem was first circulated which was destined to enjoy and to retain a higher reputation in literature than any other English poem perhaps than any other poem of the world written between Milton and Wordsworth." He continued by stressing the widespread nature of the poem: "The fame of the Elegy has spread to all countries and has exercised an influence on all the poetry of Europe from Denmark to Italy from France to Russia With the exception of certain works of Byron and Shakespeare no English poem has been so widely admired and imitated abroad and after more than a century of existence we find it as fresh as ever when its copies even the most popular of all those of Lamar tine are faded and tarnished." He concluded with a reinforcing claim on the poem's place in English poetry: "It possesses the charm of incomparable felicity of a melody that is not too subtle to charm every ear of a moral persuasiveness that appeals to every generation and of metrical skill that in each line proclaims the master The Elegy may almost be looked upon as the typical piece of English verse our poem of poems not that it is the most brilliant or original or profound lyric in our language but because it combines in more balanced perfection than any other all the qualities that go to the production of a fine poetical effect." An anonymous review of Gray in the 12 December 1896 The Academy claimed that "Gray's 'Elegy' and Goldsmith's 'The Deserted Village' shine forth as the two human poems in a century of artifice."\u000a\u000a\u000a=== 20th-century response ===\u000aCritics at the beginning of the 20th century believed that the poem's use of sound and tone made it great. The French critic Louis Cazamian claimed in 1927 that Gray "discovered rhythms, utilised the power of sounds, and even created evocations. The triumph of this sensibility allied to so much art is to be seen in the famous Elegy, which from a somewhat reasoning and moralizing emotion has educed a grave, full, melodiously monotonous song, in which a century weaned from the music of the soul tasted all the sadness of eventide, of death, and of the tender musing upon self." I. A. Richards, following in 1929, declared that the merits of the poem come from its tone: "poetry, which has no other very remarkable qualities, may sometimes take very high rank simply because the poet's attitude to his listeners \u2013 in view of what he has to say \u2013 is so perfect. Gray and Dryden are notable examples. Gray's Elegy, indeed, might stand as a supreme instance to show how powerful an exquisitely adjusted tone may be. It would be difficult to maintain that the thought in this poem is either striking or original, or that its feeling is exceptional." He continued: "the Elegy may usefully remind us that boldness and originality are not necessities for great poetry. But these thoughts and feelings, in part because of their significance and their nearness to us, are peculiarly difficult to express without faults ... Gray, however, without overstressing any point composes a long address, perfectly accommodating his familiar feelings towards the subject and his awareness of the inevitable triteness of the only possible reflections, to the discriminating attention of his audience. And this is the source of his triumph."\u000aIn the 1930s and 1940s, critics emphasised the content of the poem, and some felt that it fell short of what was necessary to make it truly great. In 1930, William Empson, while praising the form of the poem as universal, argued against its merits because of its potential political message. He claimed that the poem "as the context makes clear", means that "18th-century England had no scholarship system of carriere ouverte aux talents. This is stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it ... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities." He continued: "the truism of the reflection in the churchyard, the universality and impersonality this gives to the style, claim as if by comparison that we ought to accept the injustice of society as we do the inevitability of death." T. S. Eliot\u2019s 1932 collection of essays contained a comparison of the elegy to the sentiment found in metaphysical poetry: "The feeling, the sensibility, expressed in the Country Churchyard (to say nothing of Tennyson and Browning) is cruder than that in the Coy Mistress." Later, in 1947, Cleanth Brooks pointed out that "In Gray's poem, the imagery does seem to be intrinsically poetic; the theme, true; the 'statement', free from ambiguity, and free from irony." After describing various aspects and complexities within the poem, Brooks provided his view on the poem's conclusion: "the reader may not be altogether convinced, as I am not altogether convinced, that the epitaph with which the poem closes is adequate. But surely its intended function is clear, and it is a necessary function if the poem is to have a structure and is not to be considered merely a loose collection of poetic passages."\u000aCritics during the 1950s and 1960s generally regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place as one of the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, "At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity." Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." She continued by praising the poem: "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language."\u000aDuring the 1970s, some critics pointed out how the lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others emphasised the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, "Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways in which we are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality." In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was "a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet." When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, "Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference." Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, "While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression." In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, "With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that "The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its "enduring popularity".\u000aBy the 1980s, critics emphasised the power of the poem's message and technique, and it was seen as an important English poem. After analyzing the language of the poem, W. Hutchings declared in 1984, "The epitaph, then, is still making us think, still disturbing us, even as it uses the language of conventional Christianity and conventional epitaphs. Gray does not want to round his poem off neatly, because death is an experience of which we cannot be certain, but also because the logic of his syntax demands continuity rather than completion." Also in 1984, Anne Williams claimed, "ever since publication it has been both popular and universally admired. Few readers then or now would dispute Dr. Johnson's appraisal ... In the twentieth century we have remained eager to praise, yet praise has proved difficult; although tradition and general human experience affirm that the poem is a masterpiece, and although one could hardly wish a single word changed, it seems surprisingly resistant to analysis. It is lucid, and at first appears as seamless and smooth as monumental alabaster." Harold Bloom, in 1987, claimed, "What moves me most about the superb Elegy is the quality that, following Milton, it shares with so many of the major elegies down to Walt Whitman's ... Call this quality the pathos of a poetic death-in-life, the fear that one either has lost one's gift before life has ebbed, or that one may lose life before the poetic gift has expressed itself fully. This strong pathos of Gray's Elegy achieves a central position as the antithetical tradition that truly mourns primarily a loss of the self." In 1988, Morris Golden, after describing Gray as a "poet's poet" and places him "within the pantheon of those poets with whom familiarity is inescapable for anyone educated in the English language" declared that in "the 'Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard,' mankind has felt itself to be directly addressed by a very sympathetic, human voice." He later pointed out: "Gray's 'Elegy' was universally admired in his lifetime and has remained continuously the most popular of mid-eighteenth-century English poems; it is, as Gosse has called it, the standard English poem. The reason for this extraordinary unanimity of praise are as varied as the ways in which poetry can appeal. The 'Elegy' is a beautiful technical accomplishment, as can be seen even in such details as the variation of the vowel sounds or the poet's rare discretion in the choice of adjectives and adverbs. Its phrasing is both elegant and memorable, as is evident from the incorporation of much of it into the living language."\u000aModern critics emphasised the poem's use of language as a reason for its importance and popularity. In 1995, Lorna Clymer argued, "The dizzying series of displacements and substitutions of subjects, always considered a crux in Thomas Gray's "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard" (1751), results from a complex manipulation of epitaphic rhetoric." Later, Robert Mack, in 2000, explained that "Gray's Elegy is numbered high among the very greatest poems in the English tradition precisely because of its simultaneous accessibility and inscrutability." He went on to claim that the poem "was very soon to transform his life \u2013 and to transform or at least profoundly affect the development of lyric poetry in English". While analyzing the use of "death" in 18th-century poetry, David Morris, in 2001, declared the poem as "a monument in this ongoing transformation of death" and that "the poem in its quiet portraits of rural life succeeds in drawing the forgotten dead back into the community of the living." In 2002, Griffin claimed that the poem was "probably still today the best-known and best-loved poem in English".\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== Bibliography ==\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000a"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard", from The Thomas Gray Archive (University of Oxford)

VSonnets from the Portuguese, written ca. 1845\u20131846 and first published in 1850, is a collection of 44 love sonnets written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The collection was acclaimed and popular in the poet's lifetime and it remains so today.\u000a\u000a\u000a== Title ==\u000aBarrett Browning was initially hesitant to publish the poems, believing they were too personal. However, her husband insisted they were the best sequence of English-language sonnets since Shakespeare's time and urged her to publish them. To offer the couple some privacy, she decided to publish them as if they were translations of foreign sonnets. Therefore, planned to title the collection Sonnets from the Bosnian, but Robert counter-proposed she claim their source was Portuguese, probably because of her admiration for Camões and Robert's nickname for her: "my little Portuguese". The title is also a reference to Les Lettres Portugaises (1669).\u000a\u000a\u000a== Numbers 33 and 43 ==\u000aBy far the most famous poems from this collection, with one of the most famous opening lines in the English language, are numbers 33 and 43:\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Number 33 ===\u000aYes, call me by my pet-name! let me hear\u000aThe name I used to run at, when a child,\u000aFrom innocent play, and leave the cow-slips piled,\u000aTo glance up in some face that proved me dear\u000aWith the look of its eyes. I miss the clear\u000aFond voices which, being drawn and reconciled\u000aInto the music of Heaven's undefiled,\u000aCall me no longer. Silence on the bier,\u000aWhile I call God\u2014call God!\u2014So let thy mouth\u000aBe heir to those who are now exanimate.\u000aGather the north flowers to complete the south,\u000aAnd catch the early love up in the late.\u000aYes, call me by that name,\u2014and I, in truth,\u000aWith the same heart, will answer and not wait.\u000a\u000a\u000a=== Number 43 ===\u000aHow do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\u000aI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\u000aMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\u000aFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.\u000aI love thee to the level of everyday's\u000aMost quiet need, by sun and candlelight.\u000aI love thee freely, as men strive for Right;\u000aI love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.\u000aI love thee with the passion put to use\u000aIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.\u000aI love thee with a love I seemed to lose\u000aWith my lost saints,\u2014I love thee with the breath,\u000aSmiles, tears, of all my life!\u2014and, if God choose,\u000aI shall but love thee better after death.\u000a\u000a\u000a== See also ==\u000aThomas James Wise, who authenticated a forged edition.\u000a\u000a\u000a== References ==\u000aRobert Browning at Project Gutenberg\u000aSonnets from the Portuguese at Project Gutenberg\u000a\u000a\u000a== External links ==\u000aReely's Poetry Pages Hear Sonnets 43 and 33\u000aA Different Slant of Light: The Art and Life of Adelaide Hanscom Leeson: The Sonnets from the Portuguese by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a photo-illustration of The Sonnets from the Portuguese, includes select photo-illustrations.
